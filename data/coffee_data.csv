How do I use a coffee press?,df881q,False,True,"Do I have to grind the beans, or just put them directly into the coffee press? How would I use the coffee press if I want my coffee to use milk instead of water? Sorry if these questions are really basic, I'm a 13 year old trying to make my mom feel special on her birthday.

Edit: 

Wow! This exploded a lot, and I got my first gold and silvers ever! This is now my most upvoted post, and I can see why! Thanks for that! Also, addressing people calling me fake for telling me that I have previously called myself 14 and 15, I am actually 13. Previously, I have felt the need to make myself appear older, so that I can be taken seriously. However, anyone can start trying to brew coffee, so I thought that I could be honest on r/Coffee. I will try to give an update on the situation of wether my mom likes the coffee or not after we celebrate her birthday! Thanks for all the suggestions!

An update for you pretentious fucks,5nxd2u,False,True,"I posted here last week asking for recommendations for fancy coffee. A lot of comments mentioned how important it was to go get some freshly roasted beans, so I did.

There's a little Italian market in my city that has a ton of different freshly roasted beans for only $10 a pound. I picked out some medium roast from somewhere in south america that said something about some low acidic bullshit and went with it.  

I also watched a video online of how to use my french press properly. It was this dude talking for 8 minutes and the only thing I learned was it's important to stir up the grounds when it's steeping.  I could've gotten the point across in 10 seconds.

ANYWAYS, I made my first batch yesterday and I have another batch steeping right now. The coffee was good, not amazing but I could taste some deeper notes than a normal drip coffee.

I drank a french press full, then made another batch for my girlfriend but she couldn't drink all of it cause it was very strong, so I chugged half of that before I went out the door to my workout.

Holy shit I have never felt such a caffeine buzz. I felt amazing on my way to my workout, made it a point to talk to people when usually I'm still groggy in the morning and I felt great throughout. 

Anyways, thought I'd share. What a pleasant surprise that I actually felt a caffeine buzz on top of better tasting coffee. I'm excited to keep buying freshly roasted beans and try something new every time. 

Pretty soon I'll be just like you assholes drinking with my pinky up and giving condescending looks to people who drink folgers.",3074,2,2017-01-14 05:12:05

There needs to be a separate line at coffee shops for people who just want a straight black coffee.,c5zk8w,False,True,"Now hear me out. Im tired of waiting in line for people who are ordering grande vanilla iced coffee with soy milk and an extra pump of classic, light ice etc etc etc. All I want is a cup of black coffee. When I go to any coffee place, that’s literally all I get. I’m in and out, and they usually pour it right there. It takes  30 seconds. 

Here is why this would benefit all:
 
1. It would allow them to serve more people, quicker. With a black coffee line, they can get those customers in and out with ease, freeing up space in the regular line.

2. For the black coffee line, all you have to do is say what size you want, it’s poured, you pay, and you’re out of there, which in turn encourages those coffee drinkers to come to the store with the expectation that the experience will be quick.

3. Finally, in the line for everything else, they can already have all the flavors and cups ready so that they can attempt to service the complicated orders faster. 

It’s a win-win for everybody really.",1610,7,2019-06-26 19:05:23

It all started with an ice cube.,d1i2jn,False,True,"I don’t know where else to post this, but I kind of want to vent, so I decided to just let my thoughts out here in a community of people I don’t know and my post will most likely not be read anyways.

I used to wander into the kitchen at 4AM to see my dad sitting over the oven vent drinking his iced black coffee. I would ask him for a sip, and he would say ‘no’ to me because I was too young (I was around 6 years old?)— instead, he’d offer me a spoon of an ice cube from his coffee that I happily took and chewed on because it still had some hints of coffee on it and then I’d go back to bed. It became almost a routine thing where I would wake up early for that coffee coated ice cube with my dad. 
Years passed and when I became old enough to actually drink coffee, he showed me how he would make his instant coffee with 1:2:1 ratio of coffee, creamer, and sugar mix. In middle school, he had a newfound discovery and love for Starbucks and at one point, he would take me to Starbucks every day after picking me up from school to get a venti hot chocolate with extra cream while he got his venti coffee Frappuccino with extra coffee. He always radiated so much positive energy and was always smiling, all of the baristas knew him and would immediately greet him with excitement whilst getting ready to make his order before he even reached the cashier counter. 
In high school, my dad taught me how to brew Vietnamese iced coffee and would often make an extra serving for me whenever he brewed his own cup. I think about it now, and my addiction for coffee was never entirely due to the caffeine (coffee actually makes me sleepy). Rather than the taste, every time I drink coffee, I’m reminded of the story of how I grew up to love coffee with my dad. It all started with that spoon of coffee coated ice cube. I miss him so much. 

Some background, I suddenly lost my dad from cancer this year. I live in Nevada for school and my family lives in California. Shortly after his funeral, I had to go back to Nevada for school and work and I’ve been mourning his loss all alone in a place where I don’t have any friends or family. I’ve been having a really difficult time coping and never really had anyone to talk about my dad’s passing because it’s an uncomfortable topic that most people can’t relate to nor enjoy listening to, so I spent every day keeping to myself and going into work/school as I normally would with a huge smile. I honestly don’t feel okay and I really miss my dad. I hold so much regret for not finishing school (college) in time, not getting married, not being successful in his lifetime, and so on— but it’s been a few months now since his passing, and I’ve never been more motivated to push through school and work to live a successful life that he wished for me. To anyone who bothered to read my post, I apologize if i was a mood killer to your day, but I appreciate you for listening to my inner thoughts and I hope you have a great rest of your day. :)


Edit: 
Wow everyone, I didn’t expect so much response! Thank you all for your kind and uplifting words and for reading, my heart is so full. 

Also, thank you so much to the anon who gave me gold, I really appreciate it! I’m not a very active user on here and I honestly had to google what it was since I don’t know what to do with it... If I could, I wish I could give it back to you, but please know that you brought a huge smile to my face and made my day!

I miss my dad every day, but there are just some days like today where I just miss him a little extra. I am very fortunate that I had him in my life, and it’s the thought of him that keeps me going every day to excel in everything that I do. To the ones who’ve also lost someone, please know that it gets easier with time. You can either spend your days grieving about your loss, or you can use it as an opportunity to grow with the thought, “They would be so proud of me if they were here.” 

The last thing that your loved one would want would be to see you steering off your path. During the time period that my dad was battling cancer, he had difficulty eating, walking, and just doing ordinary things every day, but he kept insisting on doing things himself because he didn’t want my family to worry about him nor hinder our studies. I told myself, “If my dad could go through all of that and endure so much pain and sadness by himself, then I can get an A in my class and get a promotion at work.”

 Thank you everyone so much, and I hope that my story somehow moved you to also keep pushing forward, or even give your parents a hug or a call sometimes to show your appreciation.",1189,13,2019-09-08 15:34:42

So I just used a Double Stuf Oreo as an Aeropress filter...,5ks1xk,False,True,"This morning, I decided that the normal way of making Aeropress was not good enough for me. I had used an orange slice in place of a filter before and it worked ok. So I thought that if I poke a few holes in the Oreo like I did the orange slice, it would work the same. I was right! I brewed it the same way, using my usual recipe. The Oreo center added a nice creamy texture to the coffee that was complimented by the chocolate in the cookie. The only drawback was that there were either grounds or bits of Oreo floating in my coffee.

Quitting,9fmrnm,False,True,"I should preface this by saying it won't be popular, so downvote as you wish. I went deep into coffee for the past five years, tons of reading, best grinders, best beans, home-roasting, visiting plantations, the tradeshows, etc. It's been wonderful and in my memory are some very very special cups. Three months ago I realized I had developed insomnia and what felt like anxiety. What that means is that I started feeling edgy at work, quick to react,and waking every single night at 3:30am for 30 minutes, worrying about whatever situation I have in my life. 

I initially thought that it's just age, I'm 46, and its just part of getting older. I should also note that I exercise and meditate regularly, and they both helped a bit, but didn't put a dent in it. I thought of going to a doctor and looking into anti-anxiety drugs, but I'm not a fan of prescriptions unless absolutely necessary.

Thought came to me that I was up to 3 cups a day, maybe thats it. So, over the past month I've weened myself down to one half/cup in the morning, and plan to let that go next week. The results were surprising. First was that I went through mild withdrawal for two weeks. I haven't had cravings like this since I quit cigarettes. It would pop into a mind and just latch on for a while. That went away. Secondly are the results I hoped for. I feel much more calm, as if everything has slowed down a notch, and I dont react so quick. And, thankfully, Ive been sleeping through the night 90% of the time. It's such a relief. I should say that I have mixed feelings, I really miss some of the bean I used to roast and drink, but this trade-off is feeling like its worth it for me.

Knowing everyone's body is different, I won't offer opinions. I just though sharing my experience might help someone else out there who was running into the same issues.",845,28,2018-09-13 16:00:57

Two coffee pretensions that need to go ASAP,59xd85,False,True,"1) Coffee shops - start putting the prices on your whole bean bags. It's embarrassing, and wastes time, for me to ask the barista how much every single one costs. It's a shitty vibe that makes me, and many other customers, feel like you're saying ""If you have to ask, you can't afford it"". 

Yeah, in an ideal world I'd be able to just go pick out one that I enjoy the flavor of. But this is the real world and I *can't* afford a $20 bag of coffee right now. I *can* afford a $14-16 one though and I'd love to give you my money if you can provide that. Not labeling prices on your coffee just makes customers decide to not purchase anything from you.

&nbsp;

2) Roasters - give me real tasting notes (body, aroma, flavor) not some farty pseudo-poetic version of it. This is seriously what's written about Four Barrel's Ethiopia Gudina:

>AT NIGHT, WHEN THE JASMINE BLOOMS, A PRETTY DECK OF PLAYING CARDS DISSOLVES INTO LAYERS OF PETALS. THE PETALS LIE ON A TABLE IN A TROPICAL GROVE OF PAPAYA AND PINEAPPLE. MIMOSAS ARE SERVED.

I guess it was just too hard to put [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrPosTPSXxw) on a bag? I'm picking on Four Barrel here but I've seen it from other roasters. No matter what your undergrad ENG 101 professor told you, you're not a great writer. Now get back to your job making sure cherry pits don't catch fire.

&nbsp;

Seriously though, both of these things drag down the community and narrow the potential customer base. Just be open and honest about what you provide - your customer base will thank you for it by sticking with you.",819,30,2016-10-28 15:23:21

"Screw this whole ""need coffee to make coffee"" thing",cpacqq,False,True,"This morning I got up, excited to for my first cup of coffee (a beautiful Ethiopian Yirgacheffe I roasted three days ago). I weighed out my coffee, boiled my water, ground the coffee, and then knocked my grinder over spilling my coffee grounds on the carpet. Goddammit.

No worries though I guess, it happens. I reweighed my coffee, brought my water back up to temp, and ground my coffee making sure not to knock it over this time. I rinsed my filter, put my grounds in my V60, bloomed the grounds, and as I was pouring I bumped the reset button on my timer. SHIT! Well I knew roughly where it had been when I bumped it, so I'd restart it and hope for the best.

I restarted the timer, and continued my brew. Then the batteries in my scale die, and at this point I'm absolutely losing my mind. I pour what I think is probably the right amount of water through the V60, finish my brew, give it a little swirl in the cup, and taste it.

It's absolutely delicious. It the perfect cup. I've made the God cup. And I will never make the damned thing again, because I know pretty much NONE of the variables. Water weight? Who knows? Brew time? Don't know that either. Literally the only thing I know is the amount of grinds, and even that is useless because I don't know how much water went through them.

"""Do you know how to make good coffee, or should I not bother?""",6w3dyx,False,True,"Just a little anecdote from today.

I'm working behind the machine when a guy dressed in a full suit, wearing Ray Ban shades indoors, spots me from the entrance and strides directly up to my counter (walking past the cashier, who is supposed to take his order). No hello, how's your day been. Instead: ""Do you know how to make good coffee, or should I not bother?"" he grits out curtly (thus fulfilling the title prophecy), glancing down at his iPhone as he's clearly an important business man with important business things to attend to and doesn't have time for this.

Offering him a tight-lipped smile, I reply ""I'd like to think so.""

""Mhm. Blend?"" Still blunt, but this time spoken with an added air of superiority. A pretty vague question, but nonetheless I answer as best I can, which he seems satisfied with.

""Do you know how to make *ristretto*?"" (Italicised because he affected a fake Italian accent.) I tell him I do. He asks for a ristretto piccolo latte - well, demands it, really, since he 'can't stomach' a full regular shot. Makes zero sense, but okay buddy, sure thing. Normally I'd send him to the register where he's supposed to place his order, but whatever, we're not busy.

So I take his change and start making his coffee - to go, of course, his valet is probably waiting - while he sends a few texts. I imagine those texts were tersely worded, too.

Wanting to get some kind of revenge on this arrogant douchewad, but not being able to spit in his coffee while he's standing so close (/s), I do the next best thing.

I make him a normal shot of coffee.

Outrageous, you say! You're scandalised, I know; a shocking and defiant display of breaking the barista code with wild reckless abandon. Admit it, you'd do the same.

What makes this petty crime worth sharing, though, is that after making his drink, he takes a sip and looks genuinely surprised. ""I know quality, and that,"" he says with another taste, ""is an excellent *ristretto*."" He also mentions something else about 'the ristretto difference' which I don't quite remember because my mental laughter drowned it out. I smile and thank him, he unexpectedly thanks me in return, and we part ways hopefully forever.

Turns out he really just prefers ordinary coffee.

TL;dr I was being petty, made a slightly incorrect order for a pretentious know-it-all customer, he couldn't tell the difference and brags unwittingly.",683,70,2017-08-25 20:23:28

I’ve been a loyal subscriber and coffee fanatic for over a year now and you all have given me so many tips and tricks to make my coffee-life, and in turn, my real life much better. HOWEVER, I’ve noticed a trend over the past few months and I wanted to say something about it.


Recently, reddit suggested that I subscribe to r/tea... I don’t like tea but I clicked because I was curious, and I was amazed! That subreddit is so much fun. Every hour there are pictures of different teas, different venues, different tea pots, etc. Every now and then someone posts a discussion or a question that is novel and interesting. Why can’t we be like that? Scrolling through r/coffee, one only sees the same 45 questions asked in 45 different ways over and over and over, speckled by the rare interesting post like the guy who poured from the top of the doorway the other day. There’s hardly every any casual or interesting posts anymore. We’re not a community, our entire subreddit is an advice thread, whereas our interesting and fun content is limited to “Battle Station Day” or “What are you drinking day”.


I understand that there’s a lot to be learned from this sub, as I have learned here myself, but I think we have our priorities all wrong.

"EX-Mormon here, I am finally ready to try making coffee at home. I have no idea what to do, but it should be fun!",5t1bq8,False,True,"So, long story short, I was raised Mormon. Eventually realized it's unlikely that God called a prophet and the first thing to come back is polygamy... There is SOOO much more to this but that's not why I'm here. 

Mormons don't drink coffee, for some reason an early ""Prophet"" decided it's bad and now all faithful Mormons 100% abstain from coffee. This is why I am 29 years old and still don't know anything about it. 

What I have learned!

Coffee, even cheap gas station coffee is actually not that bad (IMO), it's bitter and burned, but I don't actually mind the burned taste that much. Starbucks seems to be more burned than most for some reason, but they add so much sugar to it that it ends up being good anyway. 

So... I am finally to the point where I could actually get Coffee making equipment at home and not start a fight about whether or not I will go to hell.

I still haven't decided exactly where to start. I am thinking a french press and some pre-ground from Amazon? I know there is a lot to the coffee world. My work has a coffee machine that they keep stocked for free and it grinds the beans and brews it all right there. I actually like that coffee more than what I can buy most places.

Coffee is an exciting world and for me personally it's a statement that my mind is no longer controlled by a cult. Let the coffee freedom ring! (Roast?)

Coffee victory: I have finally weaned myself off of adding sugar or cream!,7pxtj0,False,True,"About a year ago I decided I wanted to enjoy coffee in a healthier and more natural way.

Now let me tell you, this was a daunting task for a two teaspoons of sugar and many dollops of cream-sort of gal. But slowly, over time, I added less and less of each. The cream went first, then the sugar, and eventually, coffee tasted great without any sweetener needed. I’m so proud of myself, and I wanted to share this personal coffee victory!

Somewhat recently, I was struggling through some of those low feelings for a good week or so.

I put a lot of effort in and didn't cut any corners because I had more time than I normally do in the mornings. I wanted a good brew! 

Nearing the end of my first cup, I noticeably felt my spirits lifting and by the second I was in a good enough mood to turn on some music and dance about my room while getting caught up on some laundry.

Homemade Egg Coffee (Ca phe trung),cg7z9n,False,True,"[Homemade egg coffee](https://imgur.com/a/F6DgRai)

Missing Vietnam this morning so I decided to make one of my favourite beverages from Hanoi. Egg coffee! Or Ca phe trung as its known by the locals. 

The recipe for 2 cups is:

2 egg yolks (you can either live life on the edge and drink these pasteurised or just slam them down and hope the salmonella doesn’t ruin your day) 
4 tblsp of sweetened condensed milk (national milk of Vietnam)
1 tsp of vanilla extract (optional)
2 shots of very strong robusta espresso (Vietnamese coffee ideally but no need to be picky) 

Method:

Whip the living daylights out of the yolks and condensed milk. For 5 minutes at least, until it’s so thicc it could be a swimsuit model. Add in the vanilla extract about half way through. 

Boil up some steamy water. Put it in a bowl and put your cup of choice into that bowl. This is to heat up the cup. Your coffee will be pretty chilly otherwise. I skipped this step thinking “lol I don’t want a hot wet cup” and I got cold coffee as a result. 

Brew da coffee. A slow drip, strong ass coffee made of the purest robusta would be more Vietnamese. But if you want to use your fancy machines to squirt you out a shot that’s fine too. 

Spoon the thicc mix on top of the coffee. And drink up. 

I recommend you don’t stir in the egg just yet. First sip sip the sweet goodness and then after a couple mouthfuls of luxury egg foam... you can mix to your hearts delight! And enjoy the liquid tiramisu that makes me want to book a flight straight back to Vietnam.",535,124,2019-07-21 20:22:29

Review: Starbucks Reserve Christmas 2016 vs Starbucks Christmas Vintage 2016,5j95es,False,True,"[As a fan of Starbucks’ Christmas blends I decided to pick up both of their releases this year for a quick taste test.
](http://i.imgur.com/9jJe66d.jpg)

[**Standard Christmas 2016**](http://i.imgur.com/IQETLCK.jpg)

**Packaging**

Bright and red, I have to give starbucks credit here, they really know how to make a bag! It truly stands out on my shelf. 


**Beans**

Dark roast for sure, but a strong flavor escaped the bag upon first opening signifying it’s at least fairly fresh. 


**Brew**

Brewed in a v60, medium-fine and at 205 degrees.


**Flavor**

Seriously one of the best regular non-reserve Starbucks blends I’ve had. I can actually see myself drinking this regularly. 
Deep dark and complex earthy flavor. It hits you with a nutty, chocolaty, smoky flavor after you get past the earthy bang. Very bold and complex. 

**Price**

$12 and $5 gift card included making it a steal at $7 for a bag. 


**Conclusion**

I actually have always been a fan of their Christmas blend, and this year’s inclusion of aged Sumatra really shines. 


.
.
.


[**Christmas Reserve**](http://i.imgur.com/kEd7z06.jpg)


**Packaging**

I always really loved the reserve packaging. The cards they give you are easy to collect and provide lots of information on the coffee you’re drinking. The designs are pretty fantastic as well. Otherwise, it’s just a basic black reserve bag. 


**Beans**

Beans are about medium roast from what I can tell, not light but not super dark either. 


**Brew**

Brewed in a v60, medium-fine and at 205 degrees.


**Flavor**

First sip I get a ton of fruit, mandarin orange, berry, citrus. The flavor is then followed by a maple syrup flavor with a touch of smoke I’ve learned to love from Starbucks. It’s bold and thick coffee, but doesn’t punch you in the face with bitterness. 


**Price**

$17.50


Yeah, the price is a bit high. They are currently offering a $5 giftcard with any bag purchase though, so that takes it down to a fair $12.50. 

**Conclusion**


I love this blend, probably my second favorite Starbucks reserve and one of the best Sumatra’s I’ve had the pleasure of buying. I think Sumatra is Starbucks bread and butter and some of their best coffee, so it’s pretty great to see it stand out in this blend. 

...

**Reserve vs. Regular**

I would actually pick the regular roast, but not for the reason you might think. 

Yes, the reserve tastes a ton better, but it’s nearly double the price of the regular x-mas blend. The reserve also required a bit of searching, as all the stores seemed to have limited inventory around me. Whereas the Christmas blend is so easy to find and so affordable with the $5 gift card deal

As far as flavor though, the reserve is at a whole different level than the regular blend. And if I do see another bag of it, I'm definitely going to pick it up before its gone forever.

"Rashida Jones ( Parks & Rec, The Office etc.) now happily owns and Aeropress because of me!",3ccsj0,False,True,"So a little backstory. I work in an independent cafe/roastery in Oakland California. Some of our staff are friends with the fine folks that work at Pixar which is just a couple miles away. Those friends happen to be friendly with Ms Jones and they brought her by the shop the other day. 

As she was looking at the retail area we have I was making a drink on the espresso machine which is directly up against the retail shelf. She asked a couple questions about the Aeropress mainly how does it work etc. I finished the drink I was making and asked "" do you have 2 minutes ? Because I can show you start to finish how to make a cup with it."" She was more than happy to watch me go through the basics on the aeropress and I was halfway through the plunge step and she just goes "" that's it. This thing is gonna change my life! I'll take it!"" And she bought it. 

She tasted the cup of Colombia I made her and was impressed judging from her reaction. 

We at the shop play it very cool and don't ask for photos or anything like that so unfortunately I don't have visual proof. But if Ms Jones ever posts a photo of an Aeropress on the Internet, she bought it from me!",511,134,2015-07-06 15:20:53

Dad's coffee,4s0dsr,False,True,"This picture that I took this AM represents my ""inheritance"" in a physical and metaphorical sense. http://imgur.com/EfM2PFW  An ancient Hamilton-Beach/Proctor-Silex A12 basket drip maker, a framed portrait of Mr Neuman, and the sound of lovely Linda.
Some backstory:  
""Up and at 'em!"" Usually I'd groan at this. But not today. I never have figured out who ""em"" was. My dad was the quintessential retired military morning person - an anathema to a teenager.  
""Yep, I'm up."" Walking downstairs I was greeted by a very familiar set of smells and sounds, a coffee maker rumbling it's final rumbles and finishing off with a hiss, a can of Maxwell house was on the counter. I was handed a small glass of orange juice. Coffee in hand, Dad led the way to our Volvo (the 850 glt) where he handed off the keys and sat in the passenger side - an unheard-of occurrence. A crew-mate had written a poem about his steady hand at the helm of the USS Tecumseh that I would find later. We sped off with a familiar wide based coffee cup on the dash, licking the windshield with ribbons of steam. Linda Ronstadt was playing on the radio. Something from heart-like a wheel.  
""So do they call it 5-FU because it F's you five times?"" I gave my dad a sly look and got the biggest laugh of the day; we reveled in our sarcasm and shared humor.  
I sat with him as he got the chemo I was hoping would save his life, and later I packed away the coffee maker and kept it secreted away, for today it turns out.  
Now I have my own kids and finally a home office in which to set up my own coffee maker outside of the kitchen where I've experimented with presses and siphons, and today I cracked open a fresh can of Maxwell House. Betty Maxwell used to live in this house, and even though we've moved in we still call it that.  
MH coffee now comes with a caffeine boost, so I got that goin for me, which is nice. The whole office smells like I'd come to expect it always did at home, a comforting result of commodity standardization I suppose.  
The smell of the grounds was underwhelming, but once brewed it was a good cup, not too bitter, even a hint of that nutty-ness I suppose we all want in our coffee - added a bit of milk, and it's as good as anything I've had recently, even as good as many cups that have come from my siphon. Isn't that why everyone is on this sub? For the memory, the smell the shared experience? Forget about the caffeine addiction, the warm feelings of morning are enough to make you come back for a lifetime. Enjoy the sun on your faces and the love of your friends and family, and enjoy that first cup of the weekend.",503,139,2016-07-09 06:55:47

- delicious beverage
- morning ritual
- act of rebellion
- way to bond
- way to feel normal (Mormon PTSD)
- delicious beverage (again)
- and that caffeine hit is amazing

Today I abandoned my Chemex/Aeropress routine for an automatic drip machine because life is too short not to be woken up by a coffee-making robot each morning.,3ylna8,False,True,"Yes, that means I will be leaving my ground coffee overnight. I'll have to decide long term whether the hit in flavor is worth it, but for me the flavor is only part of the entire experience, and I enjoy laying in bed at 6am smelling coffee wafting through the air much more than I enjoy stumbling around the kitchen weighing, grinding, and pouring. By the time my coffee is ready, I'm usually angry at the world for forcing me to wake up before sunrise in the frozen wasteland whence I live. 

I'll definitely keep the more manual methods around for the weekend, of course. I love the Chemex's design, and the aeropress is great for a one-off cup, and supposedly for camping, although I've never bothered to do more than bring along a ziploc bag of instant granules when I've camped. 

Anyway, I'm very excited about floating through the air into the kitchen each morning on coffee smell-waves. Wish me luck. Yours in caffeination. 

**Edit:** I began my new way of life this morning. No ragrets. If you're willing to sell your soul to the god of consumerism, a nice auto-drip combined with a sunrise-simulator alarm clock is a fantastic way to awaken each day.

Is it abnormal to drink coffee in a coffee shop *without* doing anything?,59ouhg,False,True,"I normally went to the coffee shop without bringing anything to read/work. I normally leave my phone, my laptop, my books and just focus on relaxing my muscles and enjoying my cup of coffee. And I tend to close my eyes after every sip. 

Today was not a normal day - there was a family of 4, parents and two small kids. One was about a year old and the other was about 5-6, primary school age. Due to the small size of the shop we shared the same table. They were before me in the queue, so their orders came first. The kids behaved like you would expect them to - energetic, boisterous. At least until my coffee arrived. 

As usual, I took a long sniff with the coffee smell and started closing my eyes to enjoy my drink. This time somethings felt off, as I felt the kids were staring at me. Her mother was being kind and tried to distract them from directing their eye glances toward me sipping my coffee. 

A couple of sip later, the 5-6 year old boy approached me, like staring at me in person. He then split out: ""Are you planning something evil?"". About some seconds later, the younger kid started making loud noises and crying.

It was so awkward - his parents tried to pull him back. His mom told him immediately: ""You can't say that, Timmy. Apologise to him."" But the naive mind replied: ""But mom..."".

Needless to say I didn't know if it was OK to burst out loud, so I decided to give him a smile - or a stare of death based on his perspective. Then quickly I shortened my coffee break time than usual just to break the awkwardness.

Update: Why the cold brew made me so sick,4k2hd2,False,True,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/4jwcmm/why_am_i_so_sick_from_this_cold_brew/

TL;DR: I got a 16oz cold brew from a coffee shop I frequent and soon after felt very sick, to which you guys said the culprit was caffeine overdose.

So I contacted the shop via email and their owner got back to me quickly offering apologies and said they were going to retrain the staff and take another look at the cold brew recipes. He also offered me free coffee. Then today I got an email from him saying thank you as my feedback exposed a lack of communication between the new hires and the cold brew prep, so I assume my concerns that it wasn't diluted in water were correct. 

I want to go back but that was a pretty rough experience so I'm going to hold off for a little while. Just wanted to update you guys on what ended up happening with that.

As the coffee industry continues to grow and more local roasting companies pop up, the quality of locally roasted coffee isn't always guaranteed to be the best.  And some times it's down right awful.  

For example, I live in Minneapolis, a good sized metro area with a decent coffee scene.  I've tried local beans from several of the local shops.  I'd say half of them were just meh and only one or two of them were really good.  My favorite shop in the area actually serves Intelligentsia.  Most of my favorite coffee experiences have come from beans that aren't local.

So all this to say, can we stop throwing around the ""find locally roasted coffee"" advice like it's the end all be all of ways to find good coffee?  Instead maybe take a more conservative approach and say something like ""locally roasted coffee is most likely your best approach to finding the freshest coffee available to you, but it's not guaranteed to be the best""?",448,182,2018-08-09 06:20:54

Moka pot explained,bmgana,False,True,"Here's a quick explanation and [diagram](https://imgur.com/a/jZXjF1W) to illustrate how a moka pot brews.

The moka starts brewing once the hot air in the reservoir, above the water, produces sufficient pressure to push the water up through the funnel and coffee, and up through the chimney. The pressure required is a function of the grind size and dose in the basket; the appropriate grind and dose should require a decent amount of pressure to push through, but not too fine or too full such that excessive water temperature and pressure are required. The stream should be steady and slow. If it's sputtering from the beginning the grind is too fine or basket too full; if it is gushing the grind is too coarse. Heating the water too quickly, i.e. boiling, will also cause the stream to be uneven.

If the pot is left on the heat source, the temperature of the water will continue to rise as it brews. As it brews, the water level in the reservoir depletes until it reaches the bottom of the funnel (the red line).  At this point, the water can no longer flow upward and now hot air and steam is pushing through the coffee instead; this is why it gurgles and sputters at the end. 

If you leave the moka until it is sputtering, your coffee is scalded and overextracted. Still, when you disassemble your pot there will be water in the reservoir, the amount that was below the funnel tip. That is unless you left it to gurgle long enough that that bit of water boiled and all the steam went through the coffee.

If you run the pot under cold water to stop brewing, before it starts gurgling, a vacuum will be pulled in the reservoir. This will suck the coffee that hasn't come through the chimney back into the reservoir. When you disassemble the pot, there will be brown water in the reservoir because of what was sucked back in.

*Tl;dr  brown water left in the bottom of the moka pot is good, no water left is bad.*",432,196,2019-05-08 23:32:45

So I started a trend...,2kv0gh,False,True,"TL:DR Changing Navy coffee culture one Aeropress at a time.

I sever on a US Navy destroyer. Boat coffee sucks as you can imagine., often described as ""muddy water that tastes like turpentine"". It is made in a machine with 2, 5 gallon vats that are left to simmer all day. When I did my time in the galley I managed to make something at least drinkable about of it but I was super vigilant to clean it and manage the temperature. 

Anyway, looking for a easier way to get my home roasted fix in I started bringing my Hario mini and Aeropress to work. Awesome on the ship as it takes up little space and is easy to clean. At first people were puzzled, lots of penis pump jokes (we are sailors after all) then curiosity. Lots of people watching and asking questions about my method from grinding to measuring to steeping. It became routine to see me cranking away on my Hario sitting at my watch station then going off to press a fresh cup, much to the jealousy of the other watch stations drinking boat brew or monster (yuck).

So Monday is our first underway in over two years with a totally green crew. I walk into the mess deck the first morning at sea and as I am pouring my hot water I hear my name called. I turn around and there are 3 guys sitting off to the side with Aeropresses ready to go. I spent the morning teaching them the tricks. They loved it. I have a feeling I will see a lot more on the next underway. 

Also of note, the inverted method gets a little dicey at sea. We have all seen the aftermath in a stable kitchen of a coffesplosion. Imagine doing it in sea state crappy.

"I bought the $600 dollar Ratio Eight, so you didn't have to. Here are my thoughts.",5nrzt3,False,True,"Images here: http://m.imgur.com/a/yOP0g

Hello R/Coffee,
 
A few months ago I asked a simple question on this sub while searching for a new drip brewer. “Has anyone used the Ratio Eight?” Obviously, due to the price of the automatic pour over machine, only a couple people responded that they had. That being said, those responses were mostly positive. I did some research, looked for the best deal I could find, and decided to purchase a Ratio Eight.
 
Now, would I normally spend $600 dollars on a drip machine….NO. However, I was having issues with my drip machine at the time and was gifted a replacement, which I sold, and put that money towards the Ratio. Couple things I looked for when researching: 1. I wanted something unique. 2. I wanted a machine that carried an industry leading warranty. 3. I wanted something that could mimic a pour-over, but did the work for me. Obviously, there are a few machines that fit this criteria, but something about the Ratio Eight peaked my interest. The back-story, made in Portland, long warranty, premium materials, hand blown carafe, etc.
 
After much deliberation, I decided to purchase the bright silver color. Shipping took about a week and a half in total and I was extremely anxious to test the machine. Please see the photo gallery I have attached, that breaks down the shipping materials, unpacking, etc. My initial thoughts were:
 
· Unit was packaged very nice, using premium shipping materials. I loved the minimalistic box the Ratio shipped in.

· Each Ratio comes with a cleaning cloth, instruction manual, and rubber stopper for the carafe.

· Unit feels VERY premium. No plastic, just metal, wood, and glass.
 

Now that I had unboxed the machine, I wanted to brew a cup, to see if I could taste a difference. I happened to have an Ethiopian on hand, so after pre-heating the carafe, it was time to brew. The brew process takes anywhere from 6-10 mins, which in my opinion is fine, I know some like to have their coffee in under four mins. The coffee was done and finally the time had come to taste what everyone had been raving about. I took the first sip and………it was slightly above average? I say this as I could definitely taste the fruit notes, but it wasn’t a substantial difference over a Bonavita or Technivorm brewer.
 
Throughout the week I tested a few different beans, each one tasted fine, but again, nothing blew me away. In fact, I would say the coffee was under extracted at times, due to the shower head not evenly distributing water.
I honestly enjoyed just looking at the machine while it brewed, it truly is a work of art. That being said, unless you happen to have a decent amount of disposable income, it’s hard to recommend the Ratio Eight. In my opinion, $600 dollars gets you A LOT in the coffee world if you spend it wisely. You could purchase a Technivorm, Chemex, and quality grinder, all for under $600.
 
So, there you have it, in the end I returned the Ratio Eight and purchased a Technivorm. I’m just as happy with the quality of coffee in a $300 machine, as I was with the $600 machine. Please feel free to ask me any questions!
 
**TL;DR: While the Ratio Eight is a beautiful machine and a conversation starter, coffee is often times under extracted due to a shower head that doesn’t evenly saturate the grounds. You’d be better off purchasing a Technivorm, chemex (or your manual brewing method of choice), and quality grinder for under $600.**",408,233,2017-01-13 09:36:44

"My local coffee shop has wonderful, amazing beans. But their main barista makes mediocre drip coffee out of it.",7ukz44,False,True,"I work in a retail location that is a few doors down from a 3rd wave coffee shop. The shop has three baristas. They are all wonderful, kind people who I very much like seeing every day. There is one man, Charlie, who is full-time and the manager. There are two other baristas, Mary and Lisa, who are part-time. Charlie works mornings all but one day.  They have a deal where if you get their metal travel cup, you can get it filled with drip coffee for $1. A huge bargain. I get one every morning I work. 

The problem is that Charlie's drip coffee is significantly worse than Mary and Lisa's. Worlds different. I've talked to Mary and Lisa about it. They say that Charlie grinds the beans a lot finer than they do, which results in a harsh, overextracted taste. It's still good, but when Mary and Lisa make the drip coffee, it tastes like something you would pay $6 for at a snobby hipster coffee restaurant. All the notes in the beans come out just right, and when they do it, it's some of the best coffee I've had. 

Lisa has talked to Charlie about not grinding the beans so fine, but apparently he just shrugged it off. I'm just kind of sad because if Charlie changed just one little thing, I could be having amazing life-changing coffee every morning, as opposed to just ""pretty good"" coffee.

Anybody else dislike sugar / enjoy bitter coffee?,dfyigc,False,True,"I've been experimenting with adding a little bit of sugar to my coffee recently.

I drink (exclusively) Turkish coffee and have tried all the various recommended permutations for adding sugar: half a teaspoon for a ""little sweet"", one teaspoon for ""fully sweet"" etc.

(Worth noting: sugar is always added to Turkish before brewing in the cezve).

After two days of drinking sugary coffee I can definitively say that I prefer bitter, dark, powerful, unsweetened coffee hands down.

The weird thing is that after drinking a couple of bitter coffees I often crave something sweet — like a sweet or a piece of fruit. But I dislike the taste of sweet coffee and find that the sugar mildly irritates my gums after drinking — there's like this weird mouthfeel that I presume is the sugar clinging to my teeth.

Anybody else feel this way?

I also love 100% dark chocolate the the hoppiest IPAs on the menu which most of my friends find revoltingly bitter. So maybe I just have a weird palette.",403,238,2019-10-10 07:07:07
How I kept my 10 person team coffee'd up every day for 2 years - sharing my experience with a 1.5L french press.,aibrpc,False,True,"Two and a half years ago I started a new job. I have a pretty large team of designers and engineers working together here and we (almost) all drink coffee. It was rough when I started seeing everyone running out twice a day to get awful coffee; none of us were happy about it. I wasn't sure how to meet our high standards from within our own office; 10 of us sharing a Keurig would have been a catastrophe. But I was really happy with how we ultimately settled it and I wanted to share with you all.

My office is a an 18' by 22' room which my team lives in. There's a kitchenette 15 yards down the hall with a purified water tap and a sink but nothing else. 

I wasn't sure if the giant french press I'd seen at Williams Sonoma would get the same results as a regular sized one, but we decided to experiment with that. I added a small credenza to the room with a Breville electric kettle and the french press. It was an instant success. With an electric kettle and a 1.5L french press, one person could make coffee twice a day and keep the whole room supplied. That's about 8 servings for us per batch.

My cat peed on my Baratza,5si4ki,False,True,"Today I was horrified and disgusted to find that a cat in our household had climbed up on the counter and urinated on my beloved Baratza Encore.

I didn't even notice until I took off the hopper and a weird smell began to emanate. Further investigation revealed not-so-fresh cat urine that had obviously dripped down from the hopper into the burr/chute area. 

I proceeded to wretch and dry gag for fifteen minutes straight. I can simply not purge the thought of myself unknowingly drinking cat pee pourover, multiple times a day for a week.

I think I'll have to send it into Baratza, as there is urine and powdered coffee caked in places I cannot access without disassembling further than specified in the ""Care and Cleaning

 It smells so bad, you guys. My family does not know what to do with my grief. They've even gone so far as to suggest using preground coffee.

I'm a coffee shop owner in need of help to fight a heat wave,al3blt,False,True,"I own a coffee shop in front of a gigantic IT center (around 6000 employees) in Brazil. I'm pretty well liked by the customers and I'm known for my sweets (cakes, pies, creams, the famous Brazilian Brigadeiro). I've been here for the past year and business is going pretty well, but recently I've been facing 3 issues that came basically at the same time

The major issue is a massive heat wave that's been lasting for over a month now with almost every day hitting the 30ºC mark (86ºF), that considerably dropped the number of coffee cups I serve per day (from around 210 daily to 86 yesterday). I have no AC and this is already a top priority, but I'd have to do some major changes in the building structure and that would take some time (maybe a month or so)

One of the things that I did was adding Cold Drinks to my menu (IceTeas; Frappucinos; Cold Brew; Espresso Tonic; Italian Soda; Açaí), but then it comes to the second problem. I'm failing on getting people enthusiastic about it and this is one of the things that I need help doing cause while I SUCK AT MARKETING there is a Starbucks beside me that excels on doing beautiful posters and has a massive online presence.

For the past year, I was able to take the majority of the Starbucks customers by offering a better service, higher quality and lower price BUT in December the IT center in front of me did A MASSIVE change in personal, around 30% of my clientele was fired and the majority of new employees go straight to Starbucks because it's a well-established brand (I think).

I'm not on red or anything, but this January I basically broke even (Probably with a profit of $500 dollars), therefore I need to take action not only to increase my sales but also cause I know that this will last till March and next year it will be the same thing.

If you guys could help me giving some insights it would really mean a lot to me.

**I need help:**

* Bringing new customers in
* Maintaining my customers despite de Heat

**I'm currently trying**

* Selling more whole cakes, instead of the customer coming in to eat a slice they take the whole cake to do a Happy Hour, maybe a little party with their crew or even to a meeting
* Adding cold beverages to my menu

Tokyo coffee scene: my impressions / little guide,azsj28,False,True,"When preparing for my trip for Tokyo Marathon I found that various coffee guides for the city exist and they seem to recommend different locations. Indeed, when I went there myself, neither of the sources listed all of the places I liked the most! So I decided that a little guide based on my own impressions might be useful. As usual with me, this is about black filter coffee. Some Japanese places don't even have an espresso machine. Here's a list of sources i used:

[https://en.goodcoffee.me/](https://en.goodcoffee.me/) \- a massive list of coffee shops in Japan (English, but may slow down your browser)

[Recent recommendations post on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/apdg27/cafe_recommendations_in_tokyo_and_osaka/)

Drift magazine vol. 2 (offline, found in local cafe)

[This list](https://imgur.com/NUcE7XB) , provided to a friend by some prominent Japanese roaster who preferred to remain anonymous

3rd wave coffee places map from /r/coffee sidebar

&#x200B;

Be warned that Japanese coffee is quite expensive. They rarely do batch brew and a manual pourover from 'normal' specialty beans is usually 600-800 yen ($5.50 to 7.20 or so). Quite a few shops would also specialize on high-end beans like cup of excellence winners and geishas and whatnot, that can easily cost 1200-1500 per cup. Beans are usually around 1000 per 100 g and come in small 100-150 g bags.

&#x200B;

Another note: the Japanese usually roast rather dark. Not as in 'Italian roast', but much darker than in Nordic countries and probably even darker than the US, at least west coast, Chicago and NYC may be used to about the same roast level for filter. There are some international roasters who offset this.

If you don't have much time, say, just spend a couple of days in Tokyo while following sakura blossoms across the country, make sure to go to Omote-sando neighborhood which is just one subway stop away from busy Shibuya (not that it's not busy itself). This is where the density of great coffee shops is the highest. You can walk or take a short ride to Yoyogi park or Shibuya for even more coffee.

&#x200B;

So, it's been a long intro. Let's get to business.

**Cafe L'Ambre (Ginza)** \- I'm starting my list with this because if you arrive to the city via either Narita or Haneda airports, you can board Keisei Sky Access train (one of the cheaper and convenient connections btw), get out at Shimbashi station and go to this shop to jump head first into Japanese culture. It's very traditional and very good. They would suggest you a blend but I'd recomend a single origin, Kenya or Ethiopia, go with 'sun-dried' for the latter as washed is a bit flatter(both are awesome), Kenya is my favorite - syrupy and bright. Each single origin comes in an unique small cup type(yes it's 820 yen for like 100 ml coffee but trust me it's worth it). They weigh beans on scales with counter-weights and brew using handheld sock-type filter. If you're into cold brew, try that as well and ask to add cream, that's a sight to behold in a martini-like glass with coffee and milk being separate layers and not mixing. This might not be the only cafe of this kind, Kanda Coffee (Kanda) and Chatei Hatou(Shibuya) look pretty similar but I didn't have coffee there as they were packed. You should better come to L'Ambre between 12 and 2 pm - they open at noon and as soon as there are more people somebody would start smoking as they sadly allow it right there at the counter.

**Verve Coffee (Shinjuku)** \- a Japanese branch of a rather well-known American roaster. They brew great Kenya and Ethiopia. This is very much like what I drink at home (when my brewing goes right it is), so go here if you're a bit tired of exploring and experimenting come to Verve for some great coffee and maybe waffles. There's allegedly a second location in Omote-sando but I'm not sure if it even exists - Google says it does but Verve site doesn't. Also they give you a free pourover if you buy a bag of beans, so I ended up with 3 bags.

**Blue Bottle (Multiple locations)** \- also a well-known American company, it's pretty good, but not as good as Verve to my taste. They have, however, their 'mini pecan blondies' that are to die for. Their Kanda station location is the only good coffee shop I know that is close to Akihabara.

**Maruyama Single Origin Store (Omote-sando)** \- this is just a coffee nerd heaven. They have several dozens of beans from various farms, ranging from normal to ridiculously expensive, would brew you any 'for here' or to try before you buy; if you buy some beans you can get a sample 16 g pack of one of their most prized possessions. They're genuinely happy to serve you and talk about coffee. Just make sure not to miss this place! If you're used to brewing light and very light roasts like I am, you'd need to adjust your recipe as they do medium roast for most. They can even sell you some of their water for brewing in 2 liter bottles.

**Koffee Mameya (Omote-sando)** \- this is a coffee bean shop as they would explain to you when you come (warning: there may be a line) and they curate beans from roasters all over the world. I wouldn't recommend choosing anything from the bottom line of their offerings as it's a really dark roast, top three are great and juicy, second from last requires following recommended recipe meticulously just as with Maruyama. The shop looks very stylish and baristas have flawless English which is more important than one might think before coming to Japan.

**Stockholm Roast (Omote-sando)** \- this is a small stand with decent coffee combined with a tobacco shop. It looks great but the smell of smoking next to you...I'd recommend snapping it for your Instagram feed if you'd like to and passing by.

**Cafe Kitsune (Omote-sando)** \- this cafe looks quaint and can cook you a french toast. Coffee is ok, but unless your capacity for it is truly unlimited, skip coffee here and save place for Maruyama

**Coffee Supreme Tokyo (Yoyogi)** \- an NZ coffee shop expanded to Japan. As most non-Japanese ones, roasts lighter than the locals. Coffee is great, the shop is extremely stylish and you can also take the elevator to the rooftop to look around while drinking your cup.

**Fuglen (Yoyogi) -** a Norwegian company, so you're right if you expect super-light roasting style. May be a bit too tea-like for some tastes even. They serve cocktails and other drinks in the evening, too!

**Glitch Coffee & Roasters** (Kanda I guess? I walked from my hotel at iidabashi st) - these guys are 100% Japanese but proponents of light roasting. They focus on super fancy beans and hardly have 'regular specialty' stuff, like, their Kenya at 800 yen is the cheapest on offer and has weird descriptors of 'dried tomatoes'. Also the stuff has very limited English. I wish I liked this place more really! My wife wasn't bothered by this and loved it. There's a 'lifehack': a 'fast brew' at 300 yen might be any bean, just not brewed manually. I was lucky to get a Honduran Geisha (manual brew priced at 1500) which was so smooth, sweet and deeply delicious, maybe the best cup I had in Tokyo.

**About Life (Shibuya)** \- a corner stand brewing Onibus coffee. You can grab it there if you pass by and need coffee. It's good.

**Onibus Coffee (Naka-Meguro)** \- This is bit away from the busy tourist paths but the coffee is great, the shop looks very pretty, even the bean packaging is extremely photogenic. And a cup is only 490 yen. If you want to explore the scene thoroughly, make sura you don't miss this one.

**The Roastery by Nozy Coffee** ( Cat Street, halfway between Shibuya and Harajuku) - the only coffee shop I really hated. It is dark, loud and brewed me 2 coffees that tasted like charcoal. To get a pourover you have to squeeze between the espresso bar and the wall. Their high-end offerings are Brazilian beans with wacky fermentation processes which is also not my kind of thing. I had to put milk and sugar into this coffee. And ended up tossing half of the second cup anyway.",382,265,2019-03-11 04:50:00

"Want to save money? I roast organic, fair trade green coffee at home on my wok for about $5.70/lb. And it's amazing!",4z185j,False,True,"About me:

I'm a working professional who loves coffee but hates spending money on it.  I've always wanted to roast coffee but I can't get myself to spend that much money on it.  And the idea of hacking a popcorn popper seemed like more effort than it was worth to me.  Furthermore, over the last several months, I've been on this quest to use a wok for everything.

How do I do it?

**A few considerations**

* Roast your coffee a day or two before you need it. You'll need time to off-gas the beans for it to taste its best.

* Roast outside if at all possible. If you have a grill or an electric plate that will do the trick.

* If you have to roast inside, make sure you've ventilated the place pretty well.  Open windows, turn on the exhaust, turn off the smoke detectors (temporarily), and maybe add in an extra fan to circulate the air.  The fan will help get rid of the roasting smell, which, is a bit more stale than you'd expect.

* Use a wooden spoon or a whisk. I prefer the wooden spoon because it doesn't get as hot as metal objects.

* Do some arm stretches. You'll need a constant motion over the next 10-15 minutes.

**STEPS:**

1) **ACQUIRE YOUR BEANS** - Buy green beans off of the internet.  You can buy green beans from Costco, Trader Joe's, or Amazon - but I highly recommend Sweet Maria's or Dean's Beans.  Not only do you get more variety but it's generally cheaper by the pound and you can get organic/fair trade/rainforest alliance if you're into that (I am, sorry).  Note: sometimes the green coffee comes with some pebbles inside so take a quick look at your coffee and brush those aside.

2) **PRE-HEAT YOUR WOK** - Set your gas or electric range to high-medium/high and pre-heat your wok on it.  I have an electric stove and so use a flat bottomed wok. I hate electric stoves, but this has no impact on my coffee roasting.

3) **READY, SET, ROAST** - Once pre-heated, pour your green coffee beans into the wok. 

* If you want an EVEN roast, then stick to 8oz | 1/2 lb of beans or less. 

* Anymore than 8 oz | 1/2 lb of beans and you'll likely end up with a mix roast where some of your beans are of a greater roast than the others.  I actually prefer this (I prefer a medium to dark roast blend) and so roast about a lb at a time.

4) **STIR BABY STIR** - Use a wooden spoon to start stirring your beans. You want your beans to get even amounts of time against the wok.  

5) **KEEP STIRRING, YOU BIG BABY** - After about 5-6 minutes you will hear the 'first crack' and start seeing the roast kind of smoke. Wait another minute and bump the heat down to about medium. Now between 8-12 minutes you will start hearing the second crack.

What does this mean?  Roasting coffee is, as you've probably read on here before, is an 'art.'  Oh god, I just said that didn't I? I suck.  Alright well, when you roast coffee at home you need to make sure that you're watching and listening.  The different cracks will indicate which stage of the roasting process the coffee beans are in and watching for the changes in color will help you determine the roast stage that you've reached as well.

Sweet Maria's does a good job of trying to highlight the different roasts that you need to look out for: http://legacy.sweetmarias.com/roasted.pict-guide.php

Warning - around the second crack, the beans will get VERY smokey.  So make sure you have your smoke detectors off, your exhaust fans on, and even add in a fan if you need it.  If you're able to do this outside - awesome.

6) **OKAY, YOU CAN STOP STIRRING NOW** - STOP roasting when you reach about 1 stage LOWER than the final roast you want. Why? The coffee beans hold on to the heat and keep roasting after you stop.  If you roast on the stove until it reaches a dark roast and then take it off, you might find yourself with a super bitter roast since it keeps roasting.  (How many times can I say roast in a paragraph?)

7) **COOL YOUR BEANS, PAL** - Dump your beans into a colander and start aerating the beans to cool them. If you can do this, do it outside as a lot of the shells of these coffee beans will flake off of them during the roasting process and you want to remove these while aerating the beans.  These will likely fly off during the process so you might have some cleanup to do if you do it inside.  (**P.S. serious question - is this where the term, ""COOL YOUR BEANS"" comes from?""**)

8) **PAT YOURSELF ON THE BACK** - Once you've cooled your beans, set them on a tray and let them cool even more for about an hour or two.  Use this time to watch them endearingly as if you're watching your first born child sleeping in the hospital crib for the first time.  I can't wait until you're older and more mature, coffee beans. I can't wait to play catch with you, coffee beans. I'll be so proud of you when you go off to college. Sigh. 

9) **LET YOUR BEANS OFF GAS** - After your beans have cooled, stick them in plastic or paper bag to offgas for the next 24-48 hours.  The beans are NOT drinkable until at least 12-24 hours old.  I found the sweet spot to be at about 48 hours after I roasted them.  **Edit** - others are telling me that letting beans off-gas 5 days is the sweet spot. Guess I've been missing out.

10) **STORE, GRIND, BREW, SIP, REPEAT** - After the beans have offgassed, stick them in an air-tight container and enjoy them. Grind them the morning of and brew as you please.  These beans will taste great for upto 3 weeks after you've roasted them.

---
Hopefully the above helps you if you're interested in following the same steps that I take in order to regularly roast my coffee. I do about 1 lb of coffee every couple of weeks and have consistently had a great experience. If making coffee for myself I roast all 1lb at once to have a mixed roast. For making coffee for others I roast about 1/2 lb at a time to have an even roast.

I store my coffee in mason jars away from the light and grind it the morning of when I want my coffee.  I use it for pour overs, french press, and regular coffee machines. So far so good.

----

Please don't hesitate to ask any questions.  Full disclosure, this is my productive reddit account. If you think I'm a corporate Sweet Maria or Dean's Beans shill and want to see my normal account to prove that I'm not, feel free to PM me.  If you have any questions about my life in Wok-ville (making all things in a wok) feel free to ask as well.

I'll add pictures later. Hope this helps!

#EDIT(S)

**WOK PREP**:

I bought my wok unseasoned and went through a seasoning process using some peanut oil, green onions, and my oven.  It took a good Saturday morning to get that beast seasoned well inside and out. Seasoning did two things for me: 1) it essentially made the wok non-stick and 2) it helps me evenly cook things on a regular basis.  You can buy woks preseasoned but I just don't trust the chemicals that most companies use for non-stick and preseasoned cookware.  Remember: I'm a granola yuppy idiot who hates pesticieds, unnecessary chemicals in food, and microwaving plastic. I also hate non-stick things and prefer copious amounts of oil to using some sort of PTFE. That said, seasoning prevented me from having to douse every one of my foods in multiple TBSPs of oil every single time.  Important to note: **For the purposes of roasting I used ZERO oil** but it WAS a seasoned wok.  If you're using a wok or a cast-ironed pot and it isn't seasoned, you're probably in for a bad time. Not just with coffee but with most everything you're cooking in there.  So I highly recommend seasoning them or buying them seasoned.




**COSTS**:

People PMed me about my total cost of setup.  It was very minimal, but I'll break it down below:

* **Wok**:$35 -  I own a Joyce Chen flat bottom carbon steel wok that I bought from Amazon. There's a cool shop from San Francisco called The Wok Shop if you're really into getting a high quality wok. They also sell Joyce Chen woks, so I just took them up on their expertise. 

* **Coffee Beans**: $5-$8 -  I buy them from Sweet Maria's or Dean's Beans for $5.50 to $7.50/lb.  For those of you who want a trial run - Sweet Maria's sells a variety sample set where they'll send you 4 different samples (1/lb) each at $5.12 each (plus shipping - or you can pick up if you're in the west coast).  Dean's Beans doesn't have wholesale discounts but you can mix and match.

* **Colander**: $10 Steel 5-Quart Stainless Steel colander from Amazon

* **Wooden Spoon**: $12,491 - 7-inch wooden spoon carved from planks of beachwood taken from an ancient Mayan temple that was hidden in the wild coffee fields of Guatemala.  Legend has it that if you put your ear up to the spoon you will hear the ancient waves of El Lago de Atitlan crashing against its shores.  ",382,268,2016-08-22 09:02:51

PSA: The most important piece of coffee equipment...,8foe5m,False,True,"...is also one of the cheapest. I’m a coffee professional who regularly browses r/coffee and the one thing I see entirely too often is people not utilizing a scale. I know your Aeropress and your V60 came with a scoop. Throw them away. If you want to brew better coffee, drop $20 on a decent kitchen scale. I’d honestly recommend it over a grinder, if you’re only going to purchase one of the two. If you buy fresh coffee from your local coffee shop and have them grind it in store on that lovely $4000 grinder they have with the 80mm burrs, then you will not likely notice much flavor degradation for a few days, especially if you are storing it properly. However, if your ratios are off every time you brew because you’re just “eye balling”, then even the best coffee will taste like hot garbage. 

Sorry, I know this is old news to the majority around here, but I’ve just seen so many posts lately with vague, approximated measurements of coffee and water. 

*rant over* 

Carry on. 

EDIT: apologies for my use of hyperbole. I’m not saying that eye balling your dose necessarily creates “hot garbage”. I’m saying that good coffee can be ruined by a bad ratio, and ratios can slip over time from “eye balling” without scale calibration. Simmer down, now. ;)",373,274,2018-04-28 18:51:21
I am so thrilled with myself! Thank you /r/coffee! I love this community.,629ykw,False,True,"Roughly two months ago, I went down to D.C. to a Nintendo Switch event. While I was waiting, I went to this coffee shop and got a cappuccino. It was so ridiculously good. I mean that.

A week went by. All I could think about was that coffee I had. Two weeks went by. I started entertaining the idea of trying to brew my own espresso. Consumed by the memory of this delicious cappuccino, I tried everything I could to to replicate it. I desperately tried to brew a fauxspresso using my Aeropress. Spoiler: That didn't work. I visited at least 6 different coffee shops (usually up to an hour away) for good espresso. Had some decent espresso, but quickly realized this was not going to work if I wanted my daily dose of Satan's Elixir.

So I decided I was going to do it. I was going to buy a machine. Every single step of the way, I made extremely newbie posts on this subreddit, almost always got universally downvoted (I could definitely see how they came across as annoyingly naive), but without fail, there were always a handful of people in the comments who helped me out and answered my stupid questions.

I found a guy on Craigslist in my area selling a Crossland CC1 for $500, and I talked him down to $400. With the blessing of /r/coffee, I bought it. I tried desperately to pull a good shot with it, but espresso was brand new to me, and also, I'm an idiot. /r/coffee gave me the hard truth - without a decent grinder, I was going to keep pulling diarrhea shots. Even my $120 Infinity grinder was garbage for espresso. I barely believed them at first, but everyone here insisted.

A few weeks later, I summoned the fortitude (and cash) to purchase one of the highest recommended personal espresso grinders: the Baratza Sette 270. A few days ago, I got it, and immediately expected my espresso game to increase 10-fold. Wrongo.

For whatever reason, I still couldn't pull a shot to save my life. With no idea what I was doing wrong, I made another desperate post in this community (by this point, I'm sure all of you were sick of me), but to my surprise, I got a wealth of information on what I needed to do and how to rectify my garbage coffee game. (For anyone thinking of buying a Sette 270, btw, first thing you should do is install the shim that it comes with.)

So this morning I decided I would *take apart my brand new grinder* [gasp] and attempt to calibrate it properly. While this seemed like rocket surgery to me, /r/coffee insisted it was easy (sure, easy for you bean geniuses) and that it should fix my problems. *Deep breath*. Alright. Let's do this.

*Well shit.* That *WAS* easy! And suddenly my grinder was working how I wanted it to. 

Now would be a good time to mention that, throughout all of this, I never once believed the people here who said that these extremely tiny micro adjustments to the grind size made any difference at all with how the espresso turned out. For those unfamiliar with the Sette 270, it has 31 macro adjustments, and literally infinite micro adjustments. It was dubious to me that I would even need to dial it in to the macro adjustment to pull a consistent shot.

LOL. Man. I'm dumb.

So here's the payoff of this long and boring story. After roughly 11 attempts to pull a decent shot with my CC1, I *finally* did it. And, yes, I really did have to dial in the micro adjustment down to the tiniest degree. But it was all worth it. **I just had my first *excellent* double shot espresso that I made with my own two hands.** And the gracious help of this awesome community.

So thank you all so much for being helpful to an idiot like me. I now have a bright future filled with caffeinated goodness because of you all, and I couldn't be more proud of myself.",372,275,2017-03-29 15:21:56

I finally found out how to make great coffee with Moka pot!,del59t,False,True,"Well, everyone must have known the tricks already, but I'm gonna mention them anyway.

So most of the time I made coffee with my Moka pot, it tasted bitter and pretty much like very concentrated drip coffee. 

The first times I just put water in the pot, then coffee on the coffee basket (sorry, don't know England very best) and then screw the top and put it on the stove on medium heat. Couldn't say I was satisfied with the result.

I tried to change the temperature to low. Still didn't do much, although sometimes coffee did taste like espresso a little bit. But apparently this wasn't the trick I was looking for.

Which means, googling time! I looked up what I shall do. Most forums and videos said I should use already boiling water. So I did. Flavour improved like a lot, but it was still much too bitter.

Next time, I thought that maybe I was leaving it on the heat for too long. I used to leave it on the heat until there was just foam coming out and not much coffee. So this time, I put the pot off the heat as soon as the coffee coming out turned into a blonde colour.

Best coffee I've ever had.

Flavour improved dramatically. Every sip I took was leaving a long lasting aroma in my nostrils. And bitterness was also lowered a lot.

So that's what I had to do all this time. Just remove the Moka pot from the heat as soon as coffee coming out was lighter in colour, even before any foam was pouring.

From now on, I think I know what to do. Put boiling water in the pot and turn off the heat early.

So that's it. I wanted to share my coffee brewing experience because I am surprised and excited! 

What other Moka pot tricks do you know and would like to share?

Why I usually serve Nespresso to my guests...,6409x4,False,True,"First of, I'm not cheap, I don't care about the cost, it doesn't ruin me because I don't have that many guests that it would cost me a fortune.

""Is this coffee made from whole beans?"" ""Yes, I used freshly ground beans"" Guest refering to his partner ""You shouldn't drink that much, coffee made from beans is unhealthy!"".

Sometimes it’s just the coffee.,cthni4,False,True,"I recently got a Chemex, and to celebrate I splurged on a couple of fresh (and expensive) bags of Ethiopian Yirgs from a local roaster. I knew the Chemex was supposed to be great for fruit forward, floral coffees, so I was excited to experience these beans through my new toy. 

The first bag had tasting notes of blueberry and chocolate. After reading about Ethiopian “blueberry bombs” on this sub for a long time, I was ready to have my mind blown!

But cup after cup, brew after brew, I was disappointed. Sure, the coffee was good. Fine. But it was nothing like what I had expected. Hardly any fruit flavor, much less an explosion of blueberry. I was convinced I was doing something wrong, that there was something wrong with my grinder, my water, my technique. I changed my grind size, applied the tape mod to my Mini Mill, bought the right water, watched countless technique videos, searched through hundreds, thousands of r/coffee comments, just to figure out what I was doing wrong. My inexperience on the Chemex was ruining these premium beans! My days were ruined and my disappointment was immeasurable. I was just bad at Chemex. Period. End of story. It would never get better. 

And then... the beans ran out. 

I opened the next bag. I wasn’t as excited this time. I knew the best I could hope for was a hint, nay, a distant whisper of the tasting notes of lime and tropical fruit the packaging mockingly promised. Despite everything, I brewed. 

My oh my. 

It was like I was drinking freshly squeezed limeade! Punched in the face by passionfruit juice! Taking a bite right out of a pineapple! WOW! I could NOT believe my tastebuds. This was an evening cup, brewed for an night of work in the home office, but I couldn’t help sprinting out into the living room to scream unintelligibly at my non-coffee-drinking wife that HONEY, I DID THE CHEMEX FRUITY COFFEE THING!!!

Is there a lesson? A TL;DR? I guess it’s this: sometimes it’s just the coffee. Don’t get discouraged! You’ll figure out the variables. The grind size, the temperature, the technique, the weird mods and quirks and idiosyncrasies of your brewing equipment. You’ll have good cups, decent cups, and bad cups. Keep learning! Try new coffee for God’s sake! Despite everything, brew on!",368,282,2019-08-21 07:29:38

"Some things I've learned drinking, brewing, and even roasting specialty coffee for 6 years.",boctu1,False,True,"Hi Everyone, /r/coffee was my go-to coffee info source while I was starting out during the first few years (I had a different account back then). I took a reddit break for the past couple years but it's fun to be back in the community. Here are some things I have learned in my past 6 year drinking specialty coffee (not espresso).

&#x200B;

one) Don't overthink it. Really. We all spend so much wasted energy the few couple years trying to figure out dialing in and what under and over extraction tastes like (and that is very important!), but really it's about enjoying the beverage we love, the ritual of making it, and exploring each new bean / prepared cup. If it is an over extracted cup, but has lots of flavor still, enjoy what's there! It might have some (positive) flavors that you don't get when it is properly extracted. Which brings me to #2

&#x200B;

two) Get to know your grinder. The easiest way to learn the flavors is to go way too far in both directions. I personally love my Encore, even knowing there are better manuals for the money. I just love the ease and do think it is good enough to get coffee shop level quality extraction (not for espresso). I thought I had a dialed range when I started and all of my Wave cups were extremely hit or miss. It wasn't until years later when I knew the tastes of over and under waaay better, that I took my old Wave back out and realized that I was like 8 clicks too coarse on my encore (seriously). If I have made coffee with every 2-3 clicks on the entire machine, I think I would have realized it would extract better finer, sooner.

&#x200B;

three) Immersion really doesn't over extract. IMO, the main reason /u/jimseven 's method is so popular is because it fully extracts the coffee. I used to do his original [blog post](https://jimseven.com/2010/11/04/cupping-vs-french-press/) recipe which was 14 minutes and it still never became bitter, which he wrote basing it on cupping. When I make FP, I grind a few clicks coarser than my 24g v60 size, add water at 1:14 ratio, stir after some time and then pour after some time. I literally don't ever time it but I probably usually pour around 10 minutes. It never over extracts. I started to do a similar recipe with my aeropress. Same grind as FP, pour 1:14 ratio, wait a few minutes, stir, wait a few minutes more, press, maybe sometime between 6-9 minutes. It has been getting me cups that are different but on the same level as v60 which is a welcome surprise and all I've been drinking the past week. I think I would actually do the same type recipe on a Clever if I had one again.

&#x200B;

four) Water matters - The mineral content and ph of water determines what is ""pulled"" out during extraction. If a coffee from a shop tastes wildly different at home, its most certainly water. Same with a coffee from afar with tasting notes that are way different from the well extracted cups you are making. When I lived in Boston, I started to make my own water based on an updated recipe by /u/canekicker who was nice enough to converse with me and it made a huge difference. Maybe he can chime in and share it if he'd like. When I moved to Colorado, the tap water made just as good coffee as the homemade water so I stopped making it. People seem to like 3WW but from what I've learned, I'd want some buffer (Sodium Bicarb).

&#x200B;

five) Don't get stuck in coffee stereotypes. You can find washed centrals that are as wild as Ethiopian Naturals. Some Ethiopians taste like chocolatey Americans. There are Colombians that you would think are Kenyans in a blind test. Seriously. Don't get stuck on a region. Try them all and keep trying them all. I personally like Indos less than every other region, but one of my best home roasts was a Sumatran Aceh from Sweet Maria's. It was maybe the naturally sweetest coffee I ever roasted (in a popper no less).

&#x200B;

six) Naturals extraction - My wife stumbled upon this one. For years, we would get hit or miss extraction with naturals and we always felt like we weren't getting their full potential. My wife tried making a cup much stronger with one and it was bursting with the flavors listed. So we started doing that for all naturals and it kept working. With my v-60, I usually do around 1:15 or slightly stronger. With naturals, I always do around 1:13 or slightly stronger and it's been a game changer, truly.

&#x200B;

seven) Water temp - I think it matters far less than some make it out to (and I've made it out to in the past as well). I think off the boil is fine as it loses temp and become inside the 195-205 slurry temp that is recommended. I'm at altitude so off the boil for me is 206, but at sea level, I also used off the boil and at 212 it was great, too. I think anywhere between 206-212 is best. Now if you are playing with aeropress recipes, that is a different story... **EDIT:** /u/mikethebluecow pointed out that water temp extraction can depend on certain factors. So for me saying off boil is fine, A) I'm now using water that is 206 off boil and not 212 anymore and B) my particular water has it's own specific hardness and chemical makeup. Also, I'm always using light roasts. If you find that your coffee does much better at a different temp, than do what you know works! Your water might be much harder or softer or you might be using darker roasts. Everything is individual. In the 2 places I lived, everything between 206-212 worked fine, but that is a limited set of data.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: eight) Get a good enough grinder. If you haven't bought a grinder yet, save up and get one that is good enough. Baratza Encore or one of the many manuals that are popular. If you have a mini mill or equivalent, start saving up and get a better one. It's near impossible to get a good extraction on the low end grinders and you'll pull your hair out trying to figure out how to do the impossible (get even extraction).

&#x200B;

**EDIT 2**: nine) Freezing coffee. There was a lot of back and forth for a while, but after seeing the great George Howell give a presentation and mention that he advocates freezing coffee, I decided to try for myself. It really does almost completely stop the staling process. If I freeze a bag on day 5, then in 2 months, the coffee will still bloom as if it is day 5 and still have all the flavors. People also get too complex with how to freeze. If I have a frozen coffee, I just pull the bag out, weigh the dose, squeeze the air out and put it back in right away so it doesn't defrost. If you want to buy a few coffees at once or a coffee catches your eye when you already have 1, this is a great option. I wouldn't freeze more than 3 months though as it will still eventually lose flavor.

... considering buying equipment way out of my price range...

So I placed a small order for some of their Ethiopian beans, preground for an Aeropress (I know, I know, but I had no grinder access).





Long story short, I came off patrol a few weeks later to a massive, delicious-smelling package. It was, of course, a huge selection of S&W's different beans and roasts. I was mainly working at night, and I can honestly say that those beans and my Aeropress made my deployment a hundred times more enjoyable. As you can tell, I tried to pay for these beans, am (relatively) unbiased, and will not bullshit you. I've enjoyed Stumptown, Intelligencia, and more at their flagship in Portland, Los Angeles, and other locales, along with my beloved Tandem Roasters in Maine. 






The environment may have played a role, but I have never enjoyed a better cup of coffee than when I was sitting on a Hesco barrier after mission with a paper cup of S&W Roaster's Ethiopian, freshly pressed, listening to the morning prayer echo from the minarets and watching the sunrise. 





I'd planned to take some cool-guy pictures of the beautiful coffee and my guns and trucks and gear and such, but things got busy and then I was suddenly able to be home for the holidays. So I can only mention how much I value this community, well-run, honest small businesses, and the virtues of good beans that have been perfectly roasted by dedicated people who really give a shit. 





Thanks /u/swroasting

Coffee tastes significantly better if you let it rest for 10 mins after brewing it.,cbhu7r,False,True,"Initially I used to make the mistake of drinking hot coffee soon after brewing it. (Chemex, drip machine). 

But after resting the coffee for 10 minutes, it reaches a perfect temperature and tastes significantly better.

Edit: Just a few clarifications. 

By leaving it for 10 mins, I don't let my coffee cool down completely. It gets to the perfect drinking temperature but doesn't burn your mouth. 
You can taste better when coffee comes down to this temperature. The resting time depends on the weather in your place.

How come restaurants so rarely have great coffee?,8pzn6d,False,True,"So I have been wondering about this for a while.  
I love good food and often go out to eat. I usually choose restaurants in the upper range in terms og price and quality (I choose the ""Michellin\-mentions"" instead of 1 or 2 star places since I feel that the value/price\-ratio is much better).

It strikes me as strange that these places almost universally serve dark roasted ""supermarket""\-coffee. That is name\-brand imported coffees like Lavazza or Pascucci. This coffee is NOT freshly roasted, which is quite obvious when you taste it especially as espresso.

Now, this coffee is okay. It is not terrible. At least they use whole beans and grind to order, and often they have good equipment too. However, these are restaurants that would never dream of using food ingredients that are not fresh, organic, locally grown, etc.   
Why does this standard not apply to coffee? I love eating out but often I avoid having coffee to finish the meal as it is almost inevitable that I will be disappointed.   


It seems like low\-hanging fruit to increase the quality \- just buy freshly roasted beens from a local roaster (there are plenty here where I live). They already have equipment, and if their staff cannot use the espresso machine/steam milk/etc. correctly, then just make French press! French press using fresh beans are IMO 10x better than an espresso pulled ""perfectly"" using stale beans.

I am interested to know if you guys have the same experience where you live and eat? And if anyone knows why this is? Are there any barriers, or is it just lack of knowledge? I just don't get it.",341,328,2018-06-10 01:58:03

Coffee and Stomach Acid - a comprehensive guide,8mmbwa,False,True,"Hey guys I've seen a lot of question thrown around about stomach acid, heartburn and coffee. There seems to be some confusion and misinformation lying around so i figured i tried to set it straight with this post.

My qualification: i am an MD with biomedical honors degree who love coffee and diagnosed with Laringopharyngeal reflux (which i will elaborate more later)

**Types of stomach acid problems**

***Dyspepsia syndrome*** 

Dyspepsia is a syndrome - which means its just a ""collection of symptoms"". It is diagnosed when 2 out of 4 of these symptoms are present for at least 3 months

* Bothersome postprandial fullness

* Early satiation 

* Epigastric pain

* Epigastric burning

It is the less specific types of diagnosis compared to other diagnosis below. It varies from mild to severe and often used to diagnose mild chronic stomach problems. In mild cases it can be caused by ""hypersensitivity"" of the gastric pain receptor - which makes it too sensitive to pain caused by acid secretion.

***Gastritis***

Gastritis is the more severe form of stomach pain. It is basically when the bacteria H. Pylorii is present which can be diagnosed with urea breath test. 


***Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD)***

GERD or heartburn is when you felt a burning sensation in your chest. it is caused by leaking acid into the [lower esophagus near the sphincter](http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/content-public/topic/images/37/125537.gif). Roughly speaking it can be caused by slow gastric emptying OR weakness of the sphincter mixed with oversensitivity of the pain receptor in the lower esophagus

***Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)***

LPR is the more relatively severe type of stomach acid - but the symptoms varies. In LPR the acid can leap up to the vocal cord or even the nose, albeit in smaller numbers (7 drops of acid in the vocal cord can make you cough for a week). The main symptoms of LPR is chronic cough, hoarseness, and feeling like something stuck in your throat. Note: not everyone that experience LPR will experience GERD.

***Gastric / Duodenal Ulcer***

This is the more severe spectrum of stomach acid. The general red flag is stomach pain that worsen immediately after eating (for gastric ulcer) or 2-3 hours after eating (duodenal ulcer). Other more important sign are vomiting blood, black stool, and anemia. it is diagnosed with endoscopy but if you felt these important signs its better for you to immediately go to the emergency room

**When should i go to the doctor/emergency room?**

If you have one of the following:

* Age >55 year with new-onset dyspepsia
* Vomiting blood or black stool
* Difficulties in swallowing / even unable to eat
* Vomiting that can't stop
* Unintentional weight loss
* Palpable mass in the epigastric
* Anemia


**So where does coffee stands in all this?**

There are many cause of increased stomach acid. Coffee is only one of the many causes of stomach acid. The important cause are:

Increased stomach acid and direct damage to stomach acid wall

* Psychological stress
* Painkillers - NSAID (non-steroid anti inflammatory drugs)
* Caffeine - Coffee, tea, soda, etc
* Acidic foods - Coffee, Most fruits (especially citrus), tomatoes, jams, jellies, barbeque sauces, and most salad dressings
* Spicy foods - hot mustard, pepper, curry, etc
* Cigarette (through nicotine)


Loosening the sphincter

* Caffeine - Coffee, tea, soda, etc
* Alcohol
* Chocolate
* Peppermints
* Cigarette (nicotine)

Causing volatile stomach content - making it easier to leak

* Carbonated beverages

Increased pressure of the abdomen

* Pregnancy
* Any other exercise that increase the pressure in the abdomen such as weight lifting, sit ups, even vigorous singing.
* Obesity

**So if i have increased stomach acid, what can I do to keep drinking coffee?**

You have to make the commitment to change your lifestyle aside from coffee and find the right balance. If you're like me and like the stimulation of caffeine consider tapper down your caffeine consumption to once a day since there's no difference in caffeine effect if you drink 3 x a day with 1 x a day due to body habituation of caffeine. 

Commitment that you can make include:


* Lose weight
* Control your stress through routine exercise, dietary, routine sleeping pattern, and maybe even mindfulness meditation
* Eat smaller meals throughout the day rather than large lunches an dinners
* Avoid vigorous exercise at least two hours after eating and before sleep
* Avoid eating and drinking 2 - 3 hours before sleep / lying down.
* In some cases of LPR it may be beneficial to sleep with additional pillows
* Drink the drugs routinely if prescribed (note: oral PPI inhibitors such as omeprazole or lansoprazole need to be taken 30 minutes to 2 hours before ANY meals. PPI can only work in acidic condition and empty stomach. Also it took 2 - 3 days to fully work, the effect isn't instant but PPI by far is the most potent stomach acid suppressor )
* Avoid the aforementioned food that can cause increased stomach acid / weaking the sphincter
* Come to the doctors if you experience alarm symptoms
* Know how much caffeine affects your body. Each person is different and general rule is to not let caffeine affects your sleep (because when you lay down it is easier for acid reflux to happen)



**What kind of coffee is good for me**

Unfortunately most information about coffee with decreased acid is only based on stories, anecdotes, and personal experience. Not much data going around. I havent found any scientific information about cold brew (i would appreciate if anyone said otherwise). Light roast is generally more acidic than dark roast. Decaf coffee still had enough trace of coffee to cause relaxation of the sphincter 


If you already did all that AND still have stomach acid. i think its sad to say to change the types or reduce the amount of coffee that you drink. Well hope this is clear enough, do ask question in the comment section and i'll try to answer and edit the post. If you have some other topics that you like to discuss (such as how to start tappering off coffee and etc) post some in the comments and if anyone is interested i'll do some write up later


Edit: there's a LOT of concern and questions regarding drug therapy in stomach. I honestly dislike discussing about this since proper anamnesis and physical examination during doctors appointment is invaluable before prescribing drugs because theres a multitude of conditions that can cause stomach pain. Regarding long-term PPI side effect i'll make some update about it later when time permits. In general it is better to treat the stomach pain using lifestyle changes instead of long term drugs. If you have chronic heartburn / dyspepsia thats persistent but haven't had the chance to do endoscopy or urea breath test i highly advise you to go to a physician.

[Gear] I Made a Powered Coffee Grinder Stand for My Hario Skerton (X-post /r/DIY),43ovio,False,True,"Link: http://imgur.com/a/Xm1oq

I love my Hario Skerton hand grinder but it seems to take forever to grind by hand. Especially on a lazy morning before I've had my coffee. So I built a stand to run the grinder for me.


I initially powered the grinder with a hand drill, which is a common mod. But that was a clunky solution and I got tired of not having my drill in the garage where it belonged.


So, after I received a Capresso Infinity Burr Grinder for Christmas, I started this side project for the decommissioned Skerton.  I am happy with how it turned out.


Compared to the Capresso, I think I prefer the powered Skerton. Grind quality is comparable but the Skerton is of much simpler construction and is easier to clean. Also, with the screw-on container, it does a better job of containing the grounds so there is less mess.


Anyway, it was a fun project and I hope you find it interesting. Cheers!

The full story is in the original thread, but in summary, university staff entered everyone's dorm room during Winter Break to conduct a fire inspection. While doing that in my room, someone thought some items on my table full of coffee stuff looked suspicious. The police were called in, did a detailed ""plain sight"" search of my room, and confiscated my Able Aeropress filter and coffee scale. 

In the second meeting, I was told that the University won't be investigating the issue any further and the my record will not be tarnished in any way.

[How To] A concise introduction to coffee,6f6a26,False,True,"I just had a look at the wiki and saw how big of a wall of text this is. Additionally, I see the same questions popping up on this sub everyday. Because of this, I would like to aggregate some of the knowledge that gets repeated here day in day out. Of course everything I say is subjective in a sense, so feel free to comment on any of it. Also, I try to add price/equipment into every category to give some initial suggestions

**1. Basics**

As you know, making coffee can be broken down to mixing water with coffee grounds. This process can be done in many different ways, which can roughly be separated into ""brew coffee"" and ""espresso"". I will focus on brew coffee in the following, because espresso is quite expensive to get into. If there is any interest I can later add a paragraph on espresso though. Also, I won't touch on cold brew.

**2. The variables and their importance**

Mixing coffee with water can be done in many ways. However there are a limited amount of variables you have to control. The following list also represents the order of importance I think each variable inherits:

* Beans (freshness/roast date, roast quality)
* Grind (freshly ground, uniformity/grind size distribution)
* Brewing method (brewing equipment and coffee to water ratio)
* Water (quality and temperature)

**3. Beans**

This is by far the most important factor. Normally that should be clear, but still there are many people who invest into a nice setup but try to save on their beans. Imagine you want to build a house, but use subpar materials. No matter how well of an architect/builder you are, you are heavily limited by the material. Same goes for coffee. You only get as much flavour out of the beans as they offer. Here is what the sub will recommend you on your bean choice:

Buy **whole beans** (not pre ground), **freshly roasted** (within the last 2 weeks) from a local roaster. Of course you should use your beans fairly quick. There is no reason to buy a kilogram of nice fresh beans, if you don't use them quickly. You should rather buy more frequently than letting beans sit for multiple weeks. In Germany I pay around **20-30€ per kilogram** in China a little more at around 40€ per kilogram. I think the US is also more on the expensive side, but if you do a calculation per cup you will realise, that this is still way cheaper than buying a cup of coffee at a cafe. For reference: Each cup that I brew at home is around **0.3-0.5€**. Note that this is high quality coffee, that would easily retail for 3€+. Depending on the method and beans you use, that can vary a lot, but the general argument still holds.  


**4. Grind**

After the choice of beans, this is by far the next most important factor. Many beginners will heavily underestimate what difference a good grinder makes. The most important factor in this category however is, that your coffee is **freshly ground**. Depending on who you ask this will range from 1min before brewing to 10 hours before brewing, but in any way freshly grinding coffee is very important for a good cup. There is a discussion, if it is better to let a coffee shop grind your coffee, if you have a bad grinder at home. I don't really want to touch on this topic much, but if you do this you will notice a huge decline in cup quality after each day.

Anyway, it is common sense in this sub, that you should buy a grinder. This allows you to freshly grind your coffee and have nice control over grind size (which is very important for different brewing methods). Also, you should buy a burr grinder. A blade grinder (the ones with the spinning blade) produce a horrible grind. Here are the most common recommendations from this sub by price:

**Under 50€** you only have decent hand grinder options, all the electrical ones in this area suck. Common recommendations are the **Hario Skerton, Hario Mini Mill and Porlex**. Note that these are really the bare minimum. They produce an ok grind and grinding can be very tedious. Especially light roasts take a long time. If you just want to dip your toes into the world of fresh coffee, these can be a good option though.

For **ca. 120€** you can get a **Baratza Encore**. For many here this is the entry point if you want an electric grinder. It offers great value for its price and the grind quality is more than enough for a beginner.

For around **180-250€** you will hit the point of optimal value for your money. At this area you can get one of the various high quality hand grinders like a **Lido 3/E/ET, Kinu M47, Commandante MK3, Helor, Feldgrind** etc.. These will all offer great grinds, that can be on par with electric grinders more than double the price. Also important to note is, that grinding gets way easier with them. Grinding for one cup will hardly take you half a minute, which is far far better than any of the entry hand grinders. If you want to go with electronic grinders anyway you can look into the **Baratza Vario**. 

Of course there are a lot of options if you are willing to go higher in price, but that is not that significant for beginners. Please note, that there is not much to recommend between the prices I suggested above. It is pretty much, about starting out on the low end with a hand grinder, getting an Encore or going for a higher quality hand grinder. Each of these steps will offer significant improvements, anything between is hardly worth it or non existent.  

**5. Brewing method**

The nice thing about brew coffee is, that each brewing method is quite cheap (**mostly around 30€** excluding the siphon method), so you can try out many different variants. Here is a small overview:

* Hand filter (e.g. Hario V60, Kalita Wave)
* Aeropress 
* French Press
* Moka Pot 
* Siphon

Each of them has up- and downsides and you can find a lot of information about how to use them on this sub. A few things I want to mention: French Press requires a coarse grind, which can be hard with any grinders below Encore level. Siphon is more expensive and finicky than the rest. Aeropress is often recommended for beginners. 

Overall it is really about personal preference and because of the price you can really feel free to try out a lot of different methods. 

**6. Water**

This is an often overlooked fact, it is however way less important than everything mentioned above. If you have problems with your brewing even though you use good beans, have a nice grinder and have your technique down, this could be what drags you down. In the end your coffee is mostly made out of water and if you have low quality water this can have significant impact. If your tap water is bad, you can buy bottled water or ""make your own"". Information for this can be found in this sub. 

Also brew temperature has impact on the taste of your cup. Most brewing guides quickly touch on this. I think for a beginner this is not terribly important, you will be fine with boiling water and then waiting 30 seconds of or so. 

**7. Additional Tools**

Besides everything you need to make coffee, there are a few tools we highly recommend. The most important one is a **scale**. Coffee beans have very different densities. A scale helps you to keep your brew ratio the same. Also it is very essential for pour over coffee to control the pouring. This is also a very cheap item to pick up. I personally use a scale bought in China, which cost me **under 10€**. Additional nice to have items include a **goose neck kettle** for pour overs and a **thermometer** to control temperature. However, if you pick up one item of this list, go for the scale!

This cup gave me a 1.05 TDS (16.4% extraction yield. It was terrible). The second cup I brewed, I agitated the heck out of it. I use a mini whisk (Amazon for like $5 for 4). I agitate the bloom and each pour I do. Don't be afraid. Result? 1.30 ish TDS (20.3% extraction yield). TA-DA! 

* **WATER**: Oh my...This is a deep rabbit hole. I normally spend $15 for 5 packs of Global Customized AB packets that you put into distilled ($.90 gallon. Every market/Target/etc has it) jugs. Easy. But pricey...

So I saw a post on Barista Hustle from Matt Perger (World Champ) on his water recipe. It's cheap, easy, and really tasty. DONE!

Need: Baking SODA (not powder) $1, Epsom Salt (Manesium Sulfate) which can buy at the market/Target/WalMart. It comes in a big bag for like $3, and distilled water (find in the water section at your market. <$1). Add 6.8 grams (see, need that scale!) baking soda and 25 grams Epsom Salt to 500 grams distilled water. This is the concentrate. Shake it.

Add 2.5 grams of the concentrate to 500 grams of distilled water. This is the brew water. 

* **Water Temp**: Want simplicity? Stick with boiling. 30 seconds off boil will be ~210. Lock that in. Or get a Bonavita variable temp (it holds the temp. Love it). 

* **Grind Setting**: I use a V60-01. My Vario (ceramic burrs) is set at a 2J right now. This is pretty damn fine when you look/touch it. Don't worry. I change coffees (different roasters, regions, etc) every 10-ish days. My grind settings start pretty much in the 2 range. 

But if I use a Kalita 155, then I need to back WAY off on my grind settings. The 155 is messy...so I don't use it. 

* **Scale**: Don't fight it. Get one. The AWS 2KG scale is $17 on Amazon. You'll be happy you did. Or get an Acaia Pearl for $129. Pretty! 

* **Brew Ratio**: I do 19 grams of ground coffee to 330 grams of water. This is pretty standard. This will give you ~290 grams/ml of coffee (about 9.8 oz). Sometimes I'll do 19 grams to 300 grams water. Pick one and stick with it. 

That's pretty much it. Enjoy!

There was a point I'd order from McDonald's only a ""quadruple-quadruple"" coffee... Thinking about it makes my teeth and brain hurt.. And oftentimes, coffee had to be in a frap or ice capp.

Over time and making my own coffee plus through convenience, drinking black has been an eyeopener! I thought all this time, coffee just always tastes extremely bitter, sour, etc. But no, coffee can actually taste delicious.

Coffee from Aldi - seriously.,788vct,False,True,"I'll start by saying that I am a self-identified coffee snob. Typically get my coffee from a local roaster who sources his beans from an old bush pilot friend in South America. Really good stuff. 

I'm also a huge fan of Aldi. Because hey, who doesn't like saving money? Yesterday, on my usual weekly shopping trip to the big A, I spotted something new in the coffee section. Aldi is now carrying organic, whole bean coffee. I picked up a 12oz bag of the single origin Peru for $5.79 and set my expectations low.

First impressions as I filled up my burr grinder were pleasant. Nice deep aroma, consistent color and an oily sheen tells me that these beans haven't been sitting in a warehouse for too long. Set the grind to course and started my water. Used my Bodum Brazil press with a standard 12:1 ratio and a 4 minute steep time, water temp was at 200F.

I am not kidding when I say that I was floored with how good this coffee tastes. A wash of Mexican cinnamon and dark chocolate instantly filled my palate with back notes of honey and citrus fruit. So smooth and complex, I quickly finished my mug and was itching for more. 

Tl;Dr Aldi is selling organic, whole bean coffee. It's cheap but tastes like a million bucks.

The Best Coffee I've Ever Had,atz5bm,False,True,"Hello,

This afternoon I made the best coffee I've ever had. It's a naturally processed Catuai from Honduras, roasted by Metric in Chicago, and I brewed 18 grams using a Lido 3 and Kalita 155. 2:40 total brew time. The coffee is insanely fruity with berry-like sweetness and a fine, balanced acidity that reminds me of citrus. I've never gotten a better result out of it, or any other coffee at home or in a shop.

I was able to do this largely because of this sub. I've enjoyed coffee for many years, but only started to take brewing very seriously this past summer. This sub has been an invaluable source of information about gear as well as brewing theory and technique.

My experience shows that with good information and some investment, there's really no limit to how far you can take this interest. Thanks to everyone for making this place the best coffee resource on the Internet, and I encourage anyone who's getting started to leverage it and keep refining your process. The result can be extraordinary.

How can U.S. coffee shop owners push back against almost every coffee shop having become a co-working space? Perhaps pay-by-the-hour/day cafes for co-working?,ae9o8y,False,True,"With the exception of coffee shops and cafes that are closer to restaurants -- with table service -- or smaller coffee shops without any seating, the *vast majority* of U.S. coffee shops are now functionally co-working spaces that serve coffee and food. It's gotten to the point, IMHO, where if you show up with friends to have a chat at a coffee shop, you almost feel like you can't have a laugh or talk, for fear of disturbing the person coding the dog-poop-removal-and-walking app at the next table. Is this really what U.S. coffee culture should be? Is this what we want?

Shouldn't the pleasure of taking a coffee be a *respite* from work and laptops rather than just another place to be surrounded by work?

FWIW, one way Europe seems to have dealt with this -- continental Europe, not the UK -- is to create pay-by-the-hour cafes for co-working, while preserving the social environment of other cafes. In a pay-by-the-hour cafe, for about €7-9 for a half-day (about €15 for the day, cheaper with a weekly or monthly pass), you can get free unlimited espresso drinks and light snacks as you work. I've worked at a few of these in Paris and they are great value-for-money.

I'd be curious to hear your thoughts.

Necessity-- the mother of all invention. An unexpected coffee grinder in an ex-Mormon's house.,57ju0k,False,True,"As you likely know, Mormons do not drink coffee. I was raised Mormon and didn't start drinking it until Satan got a hold of my heart and exposed me to his (and y'all's) favorite beverage. I had had coffee before a few times, but it was just bitter, nasty shit. I didn't really see the appeal. Then I had some locally roasted coffee at a local bar, and I was blown away at how delicious and smooth it was, not like the swill served at Starbucks. It was there I learned I actually love black coffee and espresso. I would go there frequently just for the coffee. 

Sadly, the bar went out of business, and there's not really anything else acceptable in town. So I decided to get myself an Aeropress recently from Target. I couldn't find a decent grinder in town and will be purchasing one soon online, as soon as my budget allows.

In the meantime, I've been going to the grocery store and grinding a little bit of their bulk coffee on their machine. It was fine, but it wasn't blowing me away, like the coffee I'd learned to love. 

So I finally decided to track down the local roaster, found him on Facebook, and he directed me to a local shop where I could buy his beans. I was super stoked and bought some immediately but wasn't sure how to grind it and was thinking about just buying a cheap blade grinder in the interim.

But I knew it would be a waste of money and decided to be patient. 

Then I remembered [my Country Living Grain Mill wheat grinder](http://www.countrylivinggrainmills.com/wp-content/uploads/country-living-grain-mill-photo-wpcf_490x558.jpg). I don't know if many of you know this, but Mormons are also pretty crazy into food storage. Mormon leaders instruct that everyone should try to have a year's supply of food. So I have buckets and buckets of wheat berries and other bulk grains just kind of sitting there with this grain mill sitting and gathering dust.

I'd always used it for flour, but the grain mill is adjustable and can be used for a fine powder or can be made very coarse for grits. So I threw in a few coffee beans and adjusted the mill until I got fine, perfect, and consistent grounds. I was thrilled. I threw the grounds in my Aeropress and made a perfect cup of coffee, just like the one I had fallen in love with at the bar that closed.

So if you ever find yourself staying with a Mormon who has no kind of coffee equipment, ask them if you can use the $500 grain mill they have lying around and never use. And you've got yourself a fine cup of Joe, courtesy of Joe Smith.",311,401,2016-10-14 18:12:13

Tom Petty and the search for the perfect cup of coffee,9kskri,False,True,"Excerpt from  Tom Petty’s Biographer on the Story He Didn’t Tell from Warren Zanes, author of ***Petty: The Biography*** Original Link: [here](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tom-petty-death-biographer-warren-zanes-731414/)

*The story he told me went something like this: He’d been out driving with his wife, Dana, north of their Malibu home, when they’d stopped at a diner. The coffee there, he told me, was close to perfect. Generally reserved, even shy, he felt compelled to ask the waitress what kind it was. She didn’t know. She told him she’d ask the manager. The manager, possibly surprised that a rock & roll legend wanted information about the diner’s coffee, gave him the secret, which probably wasn’t a secret at all. It was Maxwell House.*

*“Good to the last drop.” That was, and is, the Maxwell House slogan. Originally claimed to be the words of Teddy Roosevelt, who supposedly had a cup of the stuff at Andrew Jackson’s Hermitage in Nashville, the phrase was later attributed to General Foods Corporation president Clifford Spiller. Clifford Spiller? Good to the last drop? You can’t make this shit up.*

*When Petty heard the words “Maxwell House,” he didn’t turn back. He wasn’t going to deny the truth of his experience. In his view, it was a great cup of coffee. He didn’t bow to any hipster sensibility that went against his own tastes. His response? “Can I see how you make it?” The manager took Petty into the kitchen, where a Bunn Automatic coffeemaker was doing its thing. If you look in most any diner across America, the Bunn Automatic is a pretty standard fixture. For the places that do high-volume work, their units are professional-grade, tied into the plumbing rather than just sitting on the countertop. So, not long after the diner visit, that’s what Petty installed at his home. Two of them, in fact. He didn’t want to find himself waiting for a cup of coffee.*

*But the story didn’t stop there. The following Christmas, Petty explained, when hosting a family gathering that extended over a week, a private chef providing each day’s centerpiece of a sit-down family meal, Petty was again struck by a cup of coffee. The chef was using the Maxwell House, the Bunn Automatic … yet the coffee tasted even better. Again Petty went to the source, asking the chef what he’d done. As the man explained, before he put the Maxwell House into the machine, he used a knife to level off every cup he measured out. It was exact. Not close, exact. From there on out, that’s how it would be done at the Petty home. That, Petty told me, is what I’d been drinking.*

*He was still looking directly at me, as if to make sure I was getting all of this. I felt as though he didn’t just want to tell me something, he wanted to leave a mark. The Tom Petty who had watched thousands of cowboys move across the TV screen, well, just then he looked like one of them. I couldn’t think of a whole lot else to do but take a sip of that coffee and say, “It’s good. This really is good coffee.” To which Petty said, “You got that right.”*

*Of course, if his account ends there, that doesn’t mean the story ends there. It’s mine to tell. And I kept thinking about it. Had I ever seen Tom Petty without a cup of coffee? I wasn’t sure I had. When he walked onto his bus after a show, the crowd still thinking they might get one more song, there was a cup of coffee waiting for him. On the plane? A cup of coffee. At the Heartbreaker clubhouse? Coffee.*",314,407,2018-10-02 10:17:37

[Photo] The State of Specialty Coffee in South Korea,7fz86s,False,True,"I went on a trip to South Korea this fall and stopped through a lot of coffee shops throughout the trip. I was glad to see lighter single-origins picking up over there. Funny enough, they even brought over the hipster aesthetic as well so it was easy enough to identify the coffee shops that might serve pourovers.

Korea is mentioned a lot in barista competitions so I knew there was a craft coffee scene there. Coffee shop culture is huge over there, although the percentage of people who understand and love single-origins is expectedly a small proportion of coffee drinkers as is anywhere in the West. I didn't look up specific shops but just went in a nice looking one wherever I happened to be. Looking back, I wish I spent a little time doing so because I wound up in a lot of coffee shops that was all style and no substance. 

One shop I went to was Mark Lane Coffee in the trendy Gangnam neighborhood of Seoul (yes, the song is about that neighborhood):

This coffee shop in the photos above had all the trappings of a specialty coffee shop but unfortunately it was all style. Could have been a one off experience, but the coffee was sooo watery it couldn't have been the barista's error, but rather a terrible ratio they were taught to use.

After that disappointing experience, my faith was restored when my cousin took me to a place aptly named, ""Roasters"". Roasters is in Pyeongtaek which is a small city 1.5 hours south of Seoul. (There's currently a large US army base there and on top of that, the entirety of the US military presence in Seoul is currently being moved down there. Seoul will reclaim a huge amount of real estate in the center of of the city and Pyeongtaek will see an economic boom from all the new soldiers and personnel moving in):

> My cousin and her daughter drinking coffee. Here they served you the coffee in the gooseneck kettle as a carafe. Then you poured little bits at a time so you can drink slightly cooled coffee to taste the notes while the gooseneck kept the rest of the coffee hot.

Can't go to Korea without mentioning tea. I went with my mom and family to a temple on the east coast where they had a tea shop of traditional teas. They have the greens, oolongs, etc but tea that is specifically Korean is stuff like this:

My cousin is a Zen nun (you call female monks, ""nuns"") and we went over to her temple complex to visit her. At every large temple complex they have coffee and tea shops where they serve fresh seasonal greens/oolongs and even freaking pour over coffee! This one particular coffee shop in this temple complex had the most beautiful ambiance for a coffee shop I'd ever seen. The coffee shop was a glass cube, and outside is a large deck overlooking a river and a national park:

The next morning before we left, my nun cousin brought us to have tea and coffee with the abbot of her temple. The monk made us tea, made me a pour over, and then gave us a little dharma talk:

> The monks actually roast on site too. I asked about their roasting machine but my Korean isn't very good and I couldn't understand him very well, but I think they have some kind of drum setup based on his hand motions. Their favorite is Yirgacheffe which is what was most recently roasted and what he made me. He didn't use a normal pourover technique, but would pour very little bits of water and stretched the pour to about 10 minutes. It was admittedly a dubious method but it wasn't over extracted in the end and came out nicely. He said he preferred ""espresso-like"" - basically the coffee he made with this method was thick and dense. It was evenly extracted and slightly tart, but with heavy body so no real notes of the Ethiopian.

My cousin took us sightseeing to a different temple complex a few miles away from hers. We walked around for a while and then visited the coffee shop there. The setting was like a Chinese landscape painting with rolling hills and low lying clouds. Really beautiful:

After the trips to the temple complexes in the mountains to the east, I spent the rest of my time wandering around Seoul. Something different about a lot of Korean coffee shops is that there are a lot of massive shops. Like multiple stories with each story being some absurd square footage:

I thought it was weird for a country/city where space is so limited, but I think it works financially because the cost of a coffee isn't very much less than the cost of a meal. A pour over is about ~$4.50 on average, and the average meal at a restaurant can cost you from ~$4.50 - $7.00. So basically the money they're making on each pourover is about the money a restaurant makes per meal. Maybe that's how a coffee shop can afford such a huge amount of space - but that's pure conjecture.

In America, the decor of a coffee shop can often tell you whether they're a legit specialty coffee shop or not, but in Korea they've caught up with the style more often than with substance. There's lots of well sourced, well roasted, and well brewed coffee to be found - but you have to look them up before you go if it's really important to you. Hope you enjoyed reading that wall of text.

"Fermented, hopped, whiskey-soaked oak aged coffee experiment.",a0vcfa,False,True,"Hey all. I'm mostly a lurker here since I've been more into tea lately, but like all things tasty, I still follow the coffee scene when I can.

Over the summer I got into kombucha in a major way. I started brewing my own and have at least 1 bottle a day. For those who don't know what kombucha is, it's a fermented tea that has a sour/tart taste to it. It's somewhere between sweet tea and vinegar. It's praised in the healthnut world because it has naturally occurring probiotic bacteria in it which is supposed to help with gut health. Doctors even recommend probiotics for people with digestive issues or adverse reactions to antibiotics. 

In any case, after some time brewing my own kombucha, I started thinking back to my old obsession with coffee. The wheels started churning in my brain and I did some googling and found a few blogs about people who have tried to make kombucha with coffee. Not a lot but enough to get me going. I had an extra SCOBY from my kombucha and decided to go for it. After a week, I had some pretty drinkable, tart fermented coffee. Then I went down the rabbit hole.

I have seen a few posts here about hopping coffee and found some stuff online about making hops syrup. Did some more research about hop oils and kombucha and started experimenting. Hops and fermented coffee had to happen. I did 1 or 2 batches and liked the results and decided to document it. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/dCwqSH2) is an Imgur album of my process. 

I wanted to post this here for a few reasons. Firstly to share my experience with it to the community. Secondly, I donno if this has really ever been done and felt that others out there could build on what I've tried and go from there. Maybe there is a mad scientist barista out there that wants to see where they can take this.

Feel free to ask questions or give me some criticism. I have the rest of the week off of work so I can field questions here and there.

Cheers!

"What do I do with 1,120 KG of raw coffee?",am263u,False,True,"Hi I'm Mark! I own a logistics company in the Philadelphia area. A customer I use to work with abandoned 16.5 70KG bags of raw green Colombian coffee beans. I don't know anything about this coffee's origin, nor do I know much about the coffee industry.

After reading online, its seems that the coffee industry is very different depending on your region. Past that, most people suggest to go to local coffee shops that do their own roasting with a sample. I'd like to stay away from door to door sales, especially because this is all the coffee I'll ever have.

A Great Aeropress Recipe (After a Week of Careful Notes),a7dzp1,False,True,"This past week, I've been keeping careful notes, measurements, & timings to try and perfect my Aeropress cup. After a week, what follows has been my best cup so far.

Very nuanced, slightly fruity, but smooth. Overall great cup (IMO).

I've tried to keep things very consistent, only changing a variable at a time to try and taste subtle differences and narrow down any problem areas.

First I'll cover the tools used, then lay out the method that's worked best (for my tastes).

&#x200B;

TOOLS:

\- Aeropress (inverted method, w/ included paper filters)

\- Baratza Encore Grinder

\- Gooseneck kettle (w/ filtered water from the fridge)

\- Digital thermometer

\- Timer (I'm using the Coppee app from the Google Play Store)

\- [The Coffee Compass](https://baristahustle.com/blog/the-coffee-compass/) (this is what got me started on testing variables; it really helped me to have a center to aim for and got me really thinking about flavors and what I want out of a cup)

\- Note-taking method (writing it out has been very helpful for me, as I can look back and see what worked/didn't work, and can get my thoughts down)

&#x200B;

BEANS:

\- Hologram by Counter Culture (currently just 6 days old, but I also worked with ones up to 28 days old)

&#x200B;

BEST-TASTING METHOD SO FAR:

1. Fill kettle to about 300g of water, put on stove
2. Measure out 20g of beans
3. Grind beans (setting 14 on the Encore-- it's a fine grind but not crazy fine; slightly flaky). After grinding, dump them into inverted Aeropress & level them out
4. When water hits 185F, take off stove & pour to 115g into inverted Aeropress
5. Let bloom 20 seconds
6. Stir for 5 seconds
7. Pour another 115g (230g total)
8. Let sit for 2 mins (NOTE: While it sits, I use this time to wet the filter, warm the cup, clean up, etc.)
9. Cap the Aeropress, then press for 40 seconds
10. Pour and enjoy!

RESULTING TASTE:

\- Fruity-ish, smooth, buttery

&#x200B;

IMPROVEMENTS:

\- I'd like it slightly more robust/bold/stronger

&#x200B;

Anyways, just wanted to share, but again, for anyone trying to find a better cup, that Coffee Compass I found here last week really has helped a lot.

"Thank you, r/Coffee.",d8x6ta,False,True,"So let me start this out by saying I used to be an instant coffee drinker. I live in the UK, and have been having instant coffee every day, with milk and sugar to ease the bitterness away.

Also, I'm a big tea drinker. (Mostly single estate brewed Gongfu style for anyone who cares)

It all started with an offhand comment I saw somewhere about how the difference between teabags and loose leaf good quality single estate tea is similar to the difference between instant and freshly brewed coffee.

I got curious, so started Googling. No joke, I used to think instant coffee was the only coffee. I came across the suggestion to read the World Atlas of Coffee. After reading it I understood... A little bit. With a quick Google, I found 'Pact Coffee' and saw they were selling a v60 pour over brewer and some preground coffee very cheaply. I thought this was great! Preground! Oh how naive I was.

It came the next day, and after a messy confusing brew, I tasted it and thought I found heaven. This was so much better than instant coffee! It was one of the first coffees I could happily enjoy black. I just wanted more. So I went out and bought some Starbucks preground and fell in love with that too.

I was stuck in my beautiful habit of using my tiny tea scale, spilling preground coffee everywhere, and blindly brewing preground coffee every morning and singing its praises. 

In browsing this subreddit for good preground coffee, I saw all the posts about how you shouldn't buy preground coffee. So, I researched grinders, and wasn't exactly extatic about the price.

I found what was touted as -the- entry level hand grinder, then started saving for my Porlex grinder. After a little while, it came. I ordered some light roasted beans from Hasbean, and ground. Wow. It was the most enjoyable cup of coffee I ever had. Preground coffee had never looked so inadequate. This started my downwards spiral into coffee madness.

I spent a while in this subreddit looking for tips and tricks. I got an old French press from a family member and scrubbed it, I got a cheap scale timer, I got a brita filter. I watched a ton of James Hoffman (thank you u/kingseven), improved my coffee technique and now here I am.

I'm drinking the nicest freshly ground coffee I've ever had, and I'm gonna start my very slow save for a Baratza Encore to improve my coffee drinking experience. It'll take a while, but this like tea is a habit I'm okay sinking money into even if it takes months.

I'm at the point where I'm trying not to drink multiple cups a day, and whenever I walk past my coffee drawer I smell the coffee beans and it's just pure joy. 

I'm sure I have a long way to go, I've never even had an espresso, but I want to thank you for how far you've gotten me already.

EDIT: Worth noting I had absolutely no idea James wrote The World Atlas of Coffee until weeks into watching him and months after reading it. The coffee world is a small one.",297,442,2019-09-24 19:36:29
Never let All-Time Turkish Coffee Drinkers Try Your Coffee.,abamwu,False,True,"Every one around here drinks a special kind of Turkish Coffee. A very strong, heavy-bodied, very bitter, *burnt* unfiltered shots.

So when my family saw me preparing my FrenchPress, they wanted to try it (after mocking me of course for giving coffee much effort like an ""obsessed maniac""). The reaction they gave after trying it makes you feel you give the effort to then drink garbage :(

[UK] Lidl's £1.89 Arabica beans: I try it so you don't have to,binhme,False,True,"My regular beans are a hitlist of the typical fan-favourite indie roasters. Caravan, Union, Hasbean, Square Mile etc, and these days I prefer the lighter side of roasts. That all said, I have a perennial fascination with cheap supermarket coffee beans. Despite being burned time and time  (and time) again, I apparently never learn from experience, so keep trying these cheaper beans and so far inevitably ending up using them for fridge deodorising. And less esteemed guests.

Last time was a particularly horrendous 'Kenyan AA' from Waitrose that was like suffering the flatulence of a person who mainly holidays inside domestic toasters.

Alas, while perusing the hallowed aisles of Lidl, I spotted that they now carry coffee beans, and my eyes led the way. They had a few different types, but given supermarket beans are universally charred to a crisp, I went with the lowest apparent roast, a 'strength 3' (whatever that means). At just £1.89 for 200g of some mystery Colombian Supremo beans, it didn't seem like a massive gamble. Despite this type of plan literally never working.

It took me a few days to get to it, but eventually when I wanted a second coffee of a morning but didn't want to keep ploughing through my dwindling London Coffee Festival swag supplies, I cracked open this economic bag of mystery.

As you'd expect, this 'light' roast was in fact a typical medium-dark. That said, for supermarket beans, they were pretty impressively brown, and not overly black and oily. This was somewhat encouraging. To add to it, I barely had any dialling in to do, with the same settings from a Hasbean SO appearing to pull a good 2:1 in about 34 seconds. Again, normally supermarket roasts are so dark that the beans are brittle and my first pull is way too fast. So this was a decent sign.

Now I'm not going to now say this was some life changing cup and that we should all abandon SO's and independent roasters and flock to Lidl. I mean, maybe do flock to Lidl, but do it for the reasonably priced, reasonable quality groceries. The coffee is just OK.

But OK, for a supermarket bean - that's impressive. Served as a 170ml flat white, it was a pretty well-balanced drink. A bit of an ashy aftertaste for my personal preference but totally passable, and head-and-shoulders above what I usually find with these supermarket gambles for, in percentage terms, a lot more money. This was passable morning brew for £1.89 a bag. I chalk that up as a win.

Now I'm back to enjoying a superb Union Brazilian blend ('Bobolink'), but after that, I'm taking another step into the competitively-priced field of war and trying Aldi's own, identically-priced offering. Again 'strength 3', but this time without a single mention of origin for any of its constituent beans. This could go badly.

Until next time, this is your friendly neighbourhood tightwad wishing you happy sipping, and reminding you to drink responsibly.

EDIT: For those wondering where the followup is to this, I submitted a long review only to have a mod delete it and tell me that negative reviews of commercial coffee are not welcome on this sub. Yes, that is as ridiculous as it sounds.",294,454,2019-04-29 02:29:31
I've rediscovered the french press,60uf4d,False,True,"I got into coffee a few years ago and I think the french press was the first brewing method I tried because it's so easy and requires little equipment. I think the ease with which one can brew a french press is part of the reason many don't like it - because like any brewing method, if you're using bad ingredients and bad technique it won't taste good, which for beginners is usually the case.

Fast forward about three years - I now own practically every brewing device under the sun. I had been brewing pretty much exclusively with the Hario V60 for six months or so. Then my roommate started drinking coffee more often and began using my old french press. I gave them some pointers (and let them use my Lido 2 for grinding) and then decided it'd be nice to brew a big french press for myself.

I currently have the Kenya Gatuyaini from Cafe Grumpy, roasted light-medium, full of body and fruit. I went to a coarse setting on my Lido, used a 1:16 brew ratio, and roughly followed the [James Hoffman french press brewing method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8). 

I'm blown away by how good it is. With this coffee in particular, the body is so rich, but because it's a lightly roasted coffee, it's not oily at all. Just silky and full of flavor. And because of the coarser grind used in french press it's difficult to overextract compared to a V60. In fact, I am enjoying this more than my V60 brews of the same coffee.

How I Got My 66 Year Old Grandfather Into Specialty Coffee. He's One Of Us Now :),53y3l3,False,True,"Hi everyone. I hope this isn't too long or boring but I'll try to keep it concise. :) 

I got into specialty coffee hard core about a year ago, and as I was learning more about it, I decided to have a discussion about coffee with my grandad. We talked for a good three or four hours about EVERYTHING: roast types, altitudes, and different farming methods, brew methods, tasting notes, no stone was left unturned. Eventually, I explained to him how over the past few months, I had made the switch to pour over, a method of coffee making that favors precision and care instead of my previously lazy Starbucks addiction (I know, pls don't judge) and simple drip brew. 

Seeming interested, my grandad started asking quite a few questions and was obviously skeptical of the difference in quality I was touting. So, I did what any reasonable person would do when looking down the barrel of a third wave denier and said ""Well, come over and try some."" The next day, he comes over and I brew him a local roasters Papua New Guinea. He loves it. He says right off the bat ""damn that's good,"" almost in disbelief, then as the cup is finished he says that that was the best cup of coffee he'd ever tried. I, happy with this response, invited him over a few more times and he started visiting much more frequently for morning coffee. 

Next, I upgraded my Grinder and my pour over setup from a Melitta cone to a Kalita Wave, and I decided since he loved the idea of hand prepared coffee so much, I'd give him the cone and my old grinder. He loved and used them, but still came over for my *well roasted* coffee frequently. Eventually, I convinced him to make the switch to third wave beans, and also got a scale upgrade and a Kettle upgrade, and once again handed down my old ones. He loved it all but seemed to tire of the labor occasionally so I gave him an Aeropress. 

More recently, I bought a Hario Nel and gave him one of the cloth filters and ring that I bought extra, and that's what he uses most days now. It's his absolute favorite brew method even though it's labor intensive. We go to Whole Foods every two weeks and each pick up a different bag of coffee and brew for each other every other day or so. His current setup is a gooseneck kettle, a scale, a grinder, and either an Aeropress or a Nel. He said a few days ago that it's completely changed the way he looks and experiences coffee and that he'll likely never go back to coffee as he knew it. He tossed his Mr. Coffee coffee maker a few weeks ago, he said ""I knew I'd never use it again."" 

Though we've always been close, his desire to learn more about my hobby has brought us much closer together over the past 8 or 9 months. Something as simple as sitting at a table early in the morning bonding and drinking coffee has led to many great conversations and moments. My grandad is now my best friend and I love that. I still find it amazing that I, with help from an amazing community in r/coffee, was able to dislodge a 66 year old man from the 50 year grasp of Maxwell House, and turn him towards what he considers to be a completely new world. 

He's loved the taste of bad coffee for 50 years... This year, he discovered good coffee. 
Thanks r/coffee ;) - Nick

Tl;Dr - my grandad brews 21 grams of scale measured medium ground freshly roasted coffee with 350 grams of water poured from a bonavita gooseneck kettle into his Hario pour over brewer. Be jealous.

My first espresso machine came in the mail yesterday. I ran the setup procedures and pulled about 10 shots to get the gist down (never made an espresso in my life before yesterday, I'm 42).

This morning, I did a practice pitcher of milk -- which was completely ruined and laughable (not sure I'll master this skill enough to do it in the mornings BEFORE I've had any coffee...).

Possibility to open coffee shop in rent free corner location in hometown w/o a single competitor,ccjb7m,False,True,"Was a barista serval years ago in an upstart coffee shop in Charlotte, NC called Brakeman’s. Learned quite a lot and loved the atmosphere!

Owner of 6-Cup Chemex, Aeropress, Hario v60 and an ancient French Press. 

Got to blabbing about my love and adoration for coffee to a friend I had over for Chemex. One of those types that takes coffee with about a gallon of creamer. We had Counter Culture, she had a great time. She took it black. 

Well, she works for the city we live in and we’re currently trying to revitalize the town. New businesses coming in but coffee market being missed completely. She said there’s an opportunity through city planning committee to have access to storefront with no lease and no taxes for first year. 

So, question is, what am I going to screw up?

I’m no world barista champion level creator, but i know my way around a shop with enthusiasm. 

Have a background currently in management and recruiting, so the man management and day to day stuff doesn’t scare me. Just scratching up business plan now with batch grinder, espresso grinder, espresso machine and a batch brewer at the forefront. THEN BEANS. It’s all about the beans. 

But will my reach extend my grasp? Does our tiny ex-coal mining town even need the third wave?

Can’t wait to add EDITS when you guys pick me apart!

EDIT1: Questions of market popped up. Lots of great points about my personal coffee philosophy and my market demo not matching up. I will add that currently unnamed tech company is moving a Call Center across the street from my potential space. Hence the city reno. Very intentional planning going on. 500+ jobs.

EDIT2: JUST WOW! Long time lurker here, but this community is just amazing. No condescension whatsoever, just great and helpful advice!

A £20 bladed grinder + any whole beans is 100% better than ground supermarket coffee,cubtrw,False,True,"I'm a new coffee drinker, having only just started to enjoy the drink after never touching it as a kid/teen. I started with instant but wanted something less stale so I moved onto a moka pot and ground coffee. The difference is fair and I enjoy the ground lavazza stuff quite a bit. Still, I wanted to go even better than this but I'm a cheap guy at heart. A month or so ago I bought a cheapo £20 bladed grinder from Argos here in the UK and a 1.5kg bag of some random branded beans that I got for £5 on clearance from Homesense (a clearance sale in a clearance store) and wow, the difference is incredible. Even with this bargain-bucket setup the coffee (made in my moka pot) is wonderful- smooth, full-bodied and delicious.

&#x200B;

I know that it's worth it to go all-in for the best coffee (coffee deserves it!) but I just want to say to all the cheap/frugal/poor people out there that a cheap setup like this is *still 100 times better* than any pre-ground store-bought coffee. I've since gotten some locally-roasted fresh beans and that too has jumped my cups up another notch. I'm planning to save up a budget of around £200 and get a much better grinder as soon as possible but for now, the absolute basics have simply given me a much better coffee every day and I would recommend anyone drinking supermarket ground coffee to splurge on a cheap grinder and good beans!",282,480,2019-08-23 03:08:17

I brewed on my V60, and I was BLOWN AWAY by how good this cup of coffee tasted! LOL, I have no idea how much of each bean was in there, but it was probably one of the best cups I've ever brewed.

A barista told my friend his decaff was 'poison',3oq1ec,False,True,"A friend of mine enjoys coffee but is too strongly affected by caffeine, so nowadays only drinks decaff. He went into a Costa yesterday (biggest cafe chain in the UK, even bigger than Starbucks here) and ordered a decaff.

The barista served it to him, but while doing so my friend overheard the barista say something to a colleague with the word 'poison'. My friend asked what he was talking about, and the barista said 'Decaff has poison in it - you should really research what you're putting into your body'.

First of all my friend was appalled, but he was also a little worried, and had to Google it and read about decaffeination to allay his fears. He later called Costa's central helpline and made a complaint. They apologised and gave him store credit, which is a completely acceptable resolution and he's happy now.

But what a completely perfect and horrifying example of 'Baristatude'. If it were my cafe and an employee had been talking in front of, and then directly telling a customer that our product was 'poisonous', I would be completely furious. You can be scientifically illiterate and paranoid ('chemophobic') all you like, but not when you're calling your employer's product 'poisonous' to a customer who is about to put it in their body. You're at work for crying out loud.

They then claimed that Starbucks beans also have better quality than speciality coffee roasters which is a very bold claim IMO. I pointed out that their newest beans are more than 3 months old and why they think that their beans are superior. The argument was that Starbucks can roast in much bigger batches than the small roasters which contradicts what they said before but okay. 
Also they pack their beans in sealed bags with aroma seals so its fine that the beans are older because the quality control outweights the freshness problem (more control > fresher roast).

Please help save a Starbucks barista from pulling his hair out (Dead Espresso),cemlk5,False,True,"Dead/burnt/expired/oxidized espresso is something that is talked about CONSTANTLY at Starbucks. every barista I've talked to online or in person has heard of them, and almost all believe in them. 

The idea is that if you let an espresso shot sit for 3-30 seconds (the numbers vary every time) the shot goes jet-black, and it becomes so bitter it will be completely unusable.

I work at Starbucks. I am a trainer, and I'm really into espresso (i have a small Breville machine).

I *know* that Starbucks training includes nothing about dead espresso shots. I *know* that the 4 people I know who work at other cafes, and each of their coworkers agree that dead shots aren't a real thing, and if you look it up on Google, all the results you can find will argue against it. As far as I know, there aren't any proper studies done on this (I can only assume it's because no one from outside of Starbucks even cares) 

But I can't avoid it, I've literally been working a rush, and had people take drinks from my hands and pour them out before I could get them to customers because they thought the shots had ""died"" and people are constantly making drinks incorrectly because they want to ""save"" the shots from dying. 

my question is, can *ANYONE* help me understand, and give me fuel to fight this off? because I don't know how else I can argue against it.

TLDR: ""dead"" shots aren't a thing, right?? how can i prove that?

If you want to have a pool table at home, you have to be willing to pay for it. Sure you an get a 3-in one games table from Walmart for $150 and play a game that *resembles* pool, but it is usually poorly balanced, not sturdy enough, has shitty balls/cues/felt etc. This is like getting a cheap ""espresso"" machine or as we often call it, a steam toy. 

They both may sit unused for days at a time, but if you want the luxury of having it at home in a similar quality you could get at another establishment, have to pay the price. 

Anyway, I thought /r/coffee would appreciate the comparison. I could probably go on, but I think I articulated my point decently",278,513,2015-01-05 10:58:19
In case you were wondering what a sixteen shot Americano looks like...,2jxi9x,False,True,"So a woman came in to the shop this morning and asked us to make her a sixteen shot Americano. At first, we were stunned and tried to explain to her how much caffeine is in sixteen shots of espresso, but it was very clear that she knew what she was doing. Against better judgment, we pulled sixteen shots, added a dash of water (because that was all our to-go cups could hold), and she was on her way. Is there a legal limit to caffeine content in a standard size drink? Or maybe an ethical limit?

Review of Whirlpool's 150$ attempt at a French Press,3zy1u7,False,True,"[Original post that prompted me to buy it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/3zf3yh/kitchenaids_take_on_a_french_press/)

OP posted it asking if anybody had first hand experience with it and I said I'd do it for science. The time has come people. Here's the review of the 149$ French Press. 

[Pictures because half of the product is about style](http://imgur.com/a/O3FAZ)

## Quick background/disclaimer

Here's a fair warning: I like coffee and nice things. Yes you can buy a french press for 10$. If dollars/oz of coffee is your top priority, don't buy this. I like shiny things and throwing money at my screen.

## Features
The device comes with an integrated scale and timer which allows you to measure your grounds then tare and add water in the ratio you like. It comes with a manual with a basic recipe. They basically recommend 46 grams of coffee for 739 grams of water for 5 cups of coffee. Note that a ""cup"" in the coffee universe is not actually 250ml. 

## Quality
I can't speak for the durability of the device yet because I literally used it once (drinking the coffee as I'm typing this) but the whole thing feels really solid. It should. The plunger was really stiff the first few times I used it (in clear water to clean it) but with coffee in it it was as easy to use as my other french press. The included filter is really good. I had some bad experience with other french press (Bodum) where the thread would let coffee go through but this one is great and easy to clean.

Edit: I've been using it for a month now and it's still an amazing product. I accidentally dropped it once and there's not even a kink on it. That's also why I don't buy glass french presses.

## What's the point?
Right now at home I have many options for brewing coffee. A pour over, an 8 cups french press, a Keurig 2.0. If I hate myself in the morning, I'll use the Keurig. On the weekend I treat myself with a pour over and if I'm prepping for a D&D game or I'm coding something I'll pull out the french press. But at work? I currently have a clever dripper and that's about it. Guess what? I'm a coder and I need more than about 2 cups of coffee to get me through the meetings and stuff I have to do. The integrated timer and scale is a nice touch for work because I can grind my coffee for a couple days and bring it to work and measure it on the spot. The integrated timer is just a bonus. This will become my work ""big gun"". 

## Would I recommend it?
If you have the money, like the style and want a french press with an integrated scale because you don't own one or use already ground coffee, then sure. Like I said this is not a money saving device. This is a beautiful and (hopefully) durable device. My personal experience with glass french presses is relatively bad so I like metal ones. My cup is empty. I'll go refill now.",276,515,2016-01-07 14:57:05

Just completely changed my coffee by lowering temperature.,bafq6q,False,True,"I've been brewing a Rwandan Natural for the past few weeks at either 95C or 99C with a V60 using the 4:6 and Melodrip recipes respectively. Today I was forced to brew with water around 92C, with the final pours being at around 89C due to my single plate stove being used to cook something else. I was thus unable to reheat the water back to the temperatures I wanted.

&#x200B;

What. A. Difference.

&#x200B;

I genuinely can't believe I was drinking the same coffee. I wasn't really enjoying this bean so far at all. Lowering the temperature made it taste so much better, and the flavor was so unbelievably *different*. If I didn't know better, I'd have sworn the bottom of the bag of beans had been filled with a different bean from a different country.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- if you're not enjoying a coffee, consider lowering your brewing temperature by even 3 degrees celcius - it might dramatically improve the cup you get out of it.",276,519,2019-04-07 05:24:22
"I'm ""meal prepping"" coffee by doing cold brew. Best decision ever",7bia6j,False,True,"Ever since I really started enjoying coffee I've always had to either buy coffee out, make drip coffee or use shitty or overpriced freeze dried coffees. 

Its either quite expensive, time consuming/inconvenient or just taste terrible. 

I tried ""prepping"" coffee in the past by making french press coffee but over time it just tastes terrible and more acrid after storage

After enduring some truly shitty (stomach upsetting) freeze dried coffee I decided to make cold brew with my french press. I was so ready to get disappointed with a watery flavorless brew but it turned out really really good. 

I can finally have decent coffee on the go and in the office by just having the concentrate in a thermos. I leave a large thermos in the office and bring a smaller thermos when going out and about and just add hot water (1:1 ratio) 

Good stuff. Cold brew is awesome",273,520,2017-11-07 18:24:30

Coffee Subscription Service Guide,3o96zs,False,True,"NOTICE: As of January 2017, please refer to the [wiki sub guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/wrelam_sub_guide) for up-to-date content. No more updates will be made to this post.

Recently I looked into as many coffee subscription services as I could find to see which one fit what I was looking for. I thought I would share the data I gathered with the rest of the community. I attempted to convert all prices to USD to make fair comparisons.

Price per ounce is calculated based on 11-16 oz of beans per month as that was the most common plan offered and includes shipping costs. This price could be lower/higher if you go with a different plan. If shipping cost varies then I used $6 as the shipping cost. Some services do not offer a subscription for this amount of coffee, so I noted those prices with an asterisk and wrote in the ""Notes"" section what volume of coffee that price is for.

Variety:

* \* - less than 10 roasts or only 1 roaster

* ** - 11 to 75 roasts

* *** - over 75 roasts

Plans is measured on how configurable the ordering plan can be which is a calculated based on the number of permutations of each configurable option:

* \* - 1-5 options
* ** - 6-20 options
* *** - over 20 options

Shipping is noted in order of costs to US/Canada/Global, but this cost is already included in the price per ounce.

Notable Services:

* Largest Variety:  [Angel's Cup](https://angelscup.com/)

* Cheapest: [Craft Coffee](https://www.craftcoffee.com/)

* Decent variety and price: [LA Coffee Club](http://lacoffeeclub.com/)

Before choosing a service I would ask yourself a few questions:

* Do they ship to my country?
* Can they ship coffee to me frequently enough?
* Can they deliver enough coffee to me?
* What extra perks/features do I get with this service?

#Product Review

Product Type: Coffee Filter (pour over) 💦

Manufacturer: Bounty

Model: DuraTowel

Price per filter: $0.05 (can be as low as $0.03 if you buy the jumbo packs at Costco)

---

I normally use the [Melitta 1 Cup Pour Over Brew Cone](https://shoponline.melitta.com/product/pour-over-1-cup-brew-cone-red/single-serve-pour-over-coffee-makers) with the [Melitta #2 Natural Brown Coffee Filters](https://shoponline.melitta.com/product/2-cone-filter-natural-brown-100-count/coffee-cone-filters).

On that particular and unfortunate day, I had ran out of the filters. Being a budding addict with an ever growing dependency on coffee (noobie gains are a real thing), I felt unable to start my day without some of that dark stuff in my system (I call it dark because I never drink coffee with milk).

I considered many things: 1) going to the closest Tim Hortons (yuck), 2) going to Starbucks (don't mind it), 3) chewing up the coffee grounds and flushing them down with some water. I almost did #3 before it struck me that I could use paper towels as filters.

I considered both the paper towel and the toilet paper. I knew that the toilet paper would turn to mush and end up in my cup so I decided not to use that.

I went with the paper towel. The brand, as mentioned above is Bounty. I have been a loyal Bounty paper towel user for while now. The DuraTowels especially are very strong.

I'll stop the BS and down to how I did it and some pointers for others.

I set up the system as usual. Water boiling on the stove while I put the pour over cone on my coffee cup.

I ran into difficulty as I figured out how to best make a cone out of the paper towel. It is simply to large.

I thought about cutting it in half, but decided not to. Instead I folded it over itself in half. And then I made it into a cone shape (like you would if you were making a party hat out of it).

I tucked the sides in so they wouldn't stick up and interfere with the water stream when pouring.

I placed the 'filter' into the pour over thing. I dropped a spoonful of coffee into the filter and the first thing I noticed was the due to the rough texture of the paper towel (which helps it absorb moisture) was preventing the coffee grounds from sliding smoothly down into the centre of the cone.

I tried fixing it the best I could and shook the 'filter' to make all the coffee grounds drop to the centre.

Next, I started to pour the hot water. The first thing I noticed was the paper towel soaking up MOST of the initial water poured. The water level rose as it normally does in the filter before slowly going down. But, unlike with a regular filter, it was much harder to make the raised coffee grounds that stuck to the sides of the filter to go down. The spoon also caught onto the 'filter' when trying to fix this.

Half-way through the pour, I noticed the hole in the pour over thing getting blocked and the dripping slow to a few drops every 10 seconds. Because the paper towel is so flexible and mushy when wet, it was getting sucked into the hole and causing the blockage. I had to literally lift the 'filter' a bit to allow the water to pass.

The pouring process took an unreasonably long time (I'd guess almost twice as long) because I had to constantly fiddle with the 'filter' to make sure the grounds don't stick and the hole doesn't get blocked.

Once my coffee was ready, I took a sniff and it smelled distinctly different. I could also see some very thing paper fibres floating on top. I knew the paper was bleached and came to terms with possible carcinogens that I will be ingesting.

I drank the coffee. I wouldn't say that I was gagging. But I definitely didn't enjoy it. The liquid felt 'thicker' for some reason. It was more viscous. Again, I want to emphasize that drinking the coffee was not a pleasant experience. I couldn't wait for the cup to be empty.

Long story short, I only drank a bit over half of the cup. I threw out the rest down the drain. And what I saw right after really drove the last nail in the coffin for this 'filter'.

I saw thick black goop stuck to the bottom of the glass. It wasn't much. Maybe a quarter of a teaspoon. But it was essentially coffee grounds mixed clumped together with paper fibres.

After seeing that, I'm glad I didn't finish the cup. 

I will also make sure to keep stocked up on proper coffee filters going forward.

I bought an Espresso Machine. I got a Rancilio Silvia v3 + a Rocky Grinder for $400 used on Craigslist.

I've had an alert setup for a while now, and this one popped up in a rich neighborhood where the previous owners were upgrading to a Breville Oracle Touch.

Excited to try my first homemade espresso, I get home, grab some fresh roasted beans from a place down the street and start making shots to dial in the Rocky grinder. First one tastes like shit. So I make another. Shit again. Make another.

A Thank You from a New Coffee Addict,aamlr8,False,True,"Well, r/Coffee, I've finally become one of you.

A couple months ago, there was a random Saturday morning when I decided I wanted a fresh bagel and some coffee. Before that day, I had detested coffee despite *really* wanting to like it. I went to a bagel shop close by to get what I wanted. To my genuine surprise and joy, I enjoyed the coffee (it was a light roast with a little milk and sugar to dull the bitterness). very much. Over the next couple days, I had some small coffees to make sure the Saturday trip wasn't a fluke. Thankfully, it wasn't.

I soon acquired a basic drip coffee maker and pre-ground coffee to make the cups of happiness at my apartment to save money. After using pre-ground coffee and tap water, I noticed things were good, but a little amiss. I wandered onto this sub and realized that I wasn't getting the best bang for my buck with pre-ground coffee. $25 later, I acquired a manual burr grinder and some fresh-roasted beans. Much better, but my coffee still had a metallic taste. Back onto the sub and realized that ""oh, I should get a filtered pitcher."" $15 later, the metallic taste was gone. Things were pretty awesome with my setup.

But....like all you other lovely people, I wanted more. I had been kicking around the idea of getting a Chemex because I've read a lot of praise about them on this sub as well as other places. However, I didn't pull the trigger because I didn't have a gooseneck kettle or all of that....yet.

This Christmas, my sister (a fellow coffee lover) bought me a small French press that I used for the first time today. I greatly overestimated the amount of water the press could hold and accidentally used 300 grams of water for 30 grams of coffee. Despite this little oversight, the coffee was not good; it was fucking amazing. I finally realized why a lot of you have full-on battle stations with bunches of coffee brewing apparatuses.

Back to the Chemex debate. I was in Bed Bath and Beyond a little while ago just staring at the Chemex shelf. After looking at Retail Me Not and seeing a 20% off one item coupon, I dropped the money for a 6 cup Chemex and filters. BB&B also had a $15,000 Belle Epoque Triple Group Head thing....but I'm gonna save that for another day. The gooseneck kettle was purchased online last night (thank you, Walmart gift card) and is on the way in a couple days.

I doubt I would have ever purchased whole beans, a grinder, filter pitcher, and Chemex if it weren't for you lovely bunch and your advice to other Redditors. Thank you very much - the addiction is very much real now.",264,555,2018-12-29 08:39:23

How Costa Coffee treat their staff in Saudi Arabia,byha64,False,True,"I was recently in Saudi Arabia and wanted to share some of the things I’ve learned about Costa Coffee’s practices out there. This was all discovered through conversations with the guys that work in their stores and although I knew that this kind of thing happens there I was surprised that a British, now Coca Cola owned, company is doing it. This is what I’ve learned so far, I’m still in contact with some of the guys so could reach out to them if anyone has questions.

&#x200B;

1. Costa Staff don’t have their work visas provided by the company that runs the franchise out there. The company uses third parties, either Saudi individuals or companies to get work visas for their staff. Although this isn’t technically illegal it’s very shady.
2. During training a trainee was physically assaulted by a manager/trainer. He described it as “a smack” and indicated that he was hit somewhere on his upper body.
3. Staff have gone for several months without being paid. The longest period that I’m aware of was five months. These are people from developing countries who mostly traveled to Saudi to make money so that they can support their families back home. They were literally living off of the contents of the tip jar for five months.
4. Companies that employ foreign workers in Saudi have to provide them with either accommodation or an accommodation allowance. Costa provides them with an allowance of 200 Riyals per month, this is the equivalent of $54 and leads to their staff living in really cramped conditions in small apartments. I’m told up to five a room in some cases.
5. Many of the staff have been made to work seven days a week with no overtime. Even in Saudi this is illegal.
6. Some staff have been made to work in a store alone all day with no breaks. In one of these cases the store would open at 5am and closed at 8pm. The guy would show up at 4:30am and leave around 9pm for days in row.
7. After staff have finished their contract they often have to remain in Saudi, unpaid, for a month or more (sometimes two) while Costa arranges their flight home. The guys I spoke to were never really sure why but they were told by management that they were “waiting for a cheap flight”. This is unlikely to be the case and probably has something to do with their visas.
8. At least one of the stores is on a compound which is mostly inhabited by westerners. Costa get a unit in the small shopping center there rent free and the Costa staff are accommodated on the compound with the other guys that work there. When one of the Costa staff finished his contract he remained in his accommodation on the compound until Costa had arranged his flight which took over a month. After he’d left the compound’s management billed Costa for the time he was living there but not working. Costa deducted this cost from the SALARIES of their two staff that were still working in the store on the compound.
9. Around five years ago Costa accused one of their staff of petty theft, something which he denied. Costa filed a police report but the police were apparently unwilling or unable to anything due to lack of evidence without the staff member signing a confession, something he refused to do. Costa then fired him but refused to release his passport and iqama (work visa)………… for five years. The guy was in a foreign country for five years unable to travel home or find another job. He lived off of the charity of other Costa staff the whole time and was told by Costa management that if he signed a confession he would have to serve a year in prison and would then be sent home. I have a copy of the police report and had an Arabic speaker look at it. Had he signed it he would have apparently not only been given prison time but lashes too. The latter is something I’m told he was completely unaware of. He is apparently back home now but how he lasted half a decade under those conditions I do not know.

They’ve done other shady stuff like using non-Costa beans and misleading customers about their source (I can get photo evidence of this) but I wanted to focus on the way they treat their staff with this post.

I just wanted to get the word out about some of the things western companies and their franchises get up to in the Gulf. If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask. I’m also open to suggestions about how I could get this out to a wider audience.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL:DR Costa Coffee in Saudi Arabia treat their staff terribly by doing things like withholding wages and physically assaulting them, in one case they even prevented someone from leaving the country for five years.

A coffee fan from Croatia,2rv1i5,False,True,"Hi folks, I'm new to /r/coffee. I'm from Croatia where the coffee culture is very strong, but also very different from what is described here. So it might make an interesting read for you :)

First of all, we have no coffee chains to speak off - the only one being McCafé, and it survives only because it's attached to McDonald's. No Starbucks. We had Costa Coffee, but it failed after a few years.

But we have an independant coffee shop on every corner. In a five-minute circle around my workplace, there's around 30 of them. No food is served there, but alcohol usually is. Similar to Italy, you can get an espresso, macchiato (small and large, with the small one being in an espresso cup), cappuccino, and ""white coffee"" which has much more milk. Cups are typically small, usually 1 dL or smaller. Unlike in Italy, we tend to drink our coffee very slowly (20 min - 1 h or more) and socially... we drink it with water on side (usually comes free), and usually with friends. ""Let's go out for a coffee"" is a typical way of saying ""let's hang out and talk"".

There is a small artisan coffee scene, limited to a few coffee shops.

Take-out coffee is rare, and you usually won't find it in cafes but in bakeries or kiosks. It's rarely good, and sometimes it's instant stuff.

At home, the most popular coffee is Turkish. Stores are full of pre-ground Turkish coffee - apart from instant, it's the only one which you're guaranteed to find in any store. [This](http://www.franck.eu/media/images/brandovi/kava_brand_jubilarna_brand.jpg) is probably the most popular local brand. To most people over here, the producer is more important than bean origin, and they're usually arabica/robusta mixes, dark roasts. Minas taste is very popular.

The turkish coffee pot is called ""džezva"" around this parts (pronounced similar to Turkish word for it - ""cezve""). Very few of them are fancy, tiny copper ones - most of them are larger, cheaper and more practical [stainless](http://www.ebritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dzezva.jpg) or [enameled steel](http://www.konzum.hr/var/plain_site/storage/images/proizvodi/sve-za-dom/posude-i-oprema-za-dom/tave-lonci-i-posude-za-pecenje/lonci-i-dezve-emajl/metalac-dzezva-crvena-4-kave/40144313-1-cro-HR/Metalac-dzezva-crvena-4-kave_product_full.gif) ones. In a pinch (or when cooking for a large number of people, or when camping), we can also make a coffee in a large pot. This is how we usually prepare it:

* pour water
* add a single heaping teaspoon of coffee for every cup
* add sugar per taste (since it can be sweetened after, if you're cooking for multiple people you always sweeten it according to the tastes of person who wants least sweet coffee - or no sugar at all, if someone prefers unsweetened)
* stir, put on stove and wait... don't take your eyes off it, because it will pick the moment you do to boil over :)
* when the coffee ""raises"" take it off, pour in a bit of water and wait a minute before pouring into cups
* add any additional sugar or milk to taste (some consider milk to be sacrilege in a Turkish coffee)

I prepare it a bit differently though, I use electrical kettle to bring the water to boil. Much faster results :)

Filter coffee (drip) is very rare. It was sort of popular back in 80's and 90's as a status symbol, but nowadays it's very rare, just like moka pots. The novelty of drip machines wore off, filters were an extra cost and people weren't usually fans of the filter coffee taste. People typically make Turkish coffee at home, or they use instant, or they have an espresso machine. Everything else is virtually unknown and unused (we got a French press as a gift for Christmas and we love it - though it's pretty much unknown piece of gear around these parts).

That's basically it... hope you found it informative, if you have any questions, feel free to ask :)",264,568,2015-01-09 07:10:50

So why do I never actually see solid threads discussing actual coffee?

edit: I'm trying to understand this but the only answer I got was terrible to be honest. The argument I heard was 

> If I say, ""I just had an Ethiopian coffee and it was great!"" it doesn't actually give much information to people. If they wanted to enjoy the same coffee, they have no chance of replicating the same cup of coffee without the same crop of beans at the same roast.

But no coffee enthusiast talks like that and just says ""Oh what coffee did you have?"" ""Oh Ethiopian"" There's dozens and dozens of arabica variants + different roasteries that will do things differently that results in different flavors. There are 3 botanical varieties indigenous / grown in Ethiopia alone. Then there are also companies that will make hybrid varities and try growing them in different locations. Then you have all of the roasters that will buy all of these different varities and make their own roasts, giving you the end product. Which will taste vastly different based on variety and roast.",255,577,2015-11-22 11:32:42

"""Flat white, blonde roast, milk at 140 degrees. Thanks!""",8f3mvy,False,True,"Hi! Some of you may remember me from when I [recommended ordering the milk at 140 degrees at Starbucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/7phjow/got_got_a_flat_white_as_starbucks_with_their_new/dshard5/). Or, you might possibly remember me from when I [inadvertently came off as a rich elitist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/8ahqxv/what_should_i_buy_if_i_want_to_make_espresso/dwyq3r0/). (Spoiler alert: I'm not)

Anyway, I have made three previous attempts to try the Starbucks blonde espresso roast, and was thwarted every time either by location or luck. I finally got my opportunity in the Tampa airport, gate D. I placed my order: ""Flat white, blonde roast, milk at 140 degrees."" along with an almond milk latte for my wife. I walked around the counter and watched the barista ... make my drink wrong.

She used the regular beans.

So, I ignored all of my midwestern upbringing and (very politely! I'm not an elitist snob!) said, ""Did you make that flat white with the blonde roast? Because that's what I ordered."" She was very kind, admitted her mistake, and very pleasantly made me the drink as I ordered it.

It was ... good. Asking for the milk at 140 degrees means it's drinkable right away, and there is no danger of getting that scalded milk taste. The blonde roast is much smoother than their charred bean roast. I will go so far as to say that it was **the best coffee I had on our vacation**.

I'll have to try another one to confirm if this is truly a successful order, but I'm hopeful.",254,581,2018-04-26 08:43:43

Long story short, I take meds for ADHD, and those mixed with caffeine were doing some funky things to my heart, so it was either no caffeine, or no focusing on anything ever again.

I have been in the specialty coffee scene for awhile now, working in cafes the past three years. I love coffee. I love the taste. I love the chemestry and science behind it all. I am also afraid that with decaf nothing is ever going to taste as good as a fresh roasted Burundi or Ethiopian.

I have never done any research into tasty decaf coffees, but was wondering if any of you fine people have? Any suggestions would be much appreciated!",254,588,2019-05-13 03:50:14
Just a quick story!,7gecbg,False,True,"So I've been a little down recently for personal reasons and to top it all off I got back into pour over and all my brews were coming out not so great. 

Yesterday, when I poured my chemex into my cup, it completely overflowed. This is when I realized, my scale might be off. Sure enough after some tests, I found out my scale was indeed broken. So I went out and bought a new one last night.

So I thought I would pull out my old Moka Pot that was given to me from my late Grandmother tonight.

You might know me from my blog - [www.jimseven.com](http://www.jimseven.com) - which I've been writing for the last 10 years.

I'm a founder and the Managing Director of Square Mile Coffee Roasters.
We are a small, quality focused roasting company in London. I was also the World Barista Champion in 2007.

I collaborated with manufacturers like Nuova Simonello/Victoria Arduino, and Marco to create various bits of equipment.

I also help publish a magazine called [Longberry](http://longberrypress.com/), and run a [jobs](http://www.coffeejobsboard.com) website dedicated to coffee people.

New favorite espresso drink,bdm136,False,True,"Last week, the wife and I wanted to split an espresso, but wanted more than 1 sip each. I asked the barista if we could get a mini americano in a cortado glass and he said that's what he's been drinking lately and then made me the best drink I've had in the past 6 months. It was 2 oz of espresso and \~1.5 oz of water. 

&#x200B;

It was great because it retained all of the flavors, while being only slightly less strong. Americanos are always too weak for me and I don't feel like they showcase the flavors well enough.. Espresso is amazing but sometimes I want an extra few sips and a little ""space"" between the flavors which the small amount of water gives it. I recommend trying it!",251,615,2019-04-15 15:14:08
Local café put me in my place this morning.,b0onea,False,True,"I’ve spent 3 months buying quality beans ($0.75-1.00 per serving), using Berkey-filtered water, and making coffee using a modest French Press setup. Total investment in equipment less than $100.

This morning, I walked 15 minutes over to the coffee shop downtown that everyone raves about and ordered a 20oz batch brew for $4. First sip on my way out the door and I was surprised to actually taste chocolate. The strong notes did not persist but were definitely there at the beginning. Best coffee I’ve had to date.

Right now I’m at a crossroads where I’ve barely invested much time, money, and energy to home-brewing. I could absolutely dive into the craft, but part of me thinks I should just let the professionals be professionals and pay their reasonable price. When factoring in my ~30 min setup and clean-up process, is saving $3 per day really worth it? Not to mention that most of the time, my beans would not be as fresh as those used at the cafe.  Also not to mention that researching coffee and watching James Hoffmann videos will burn up even more time.

I guess the question is whether I enjoy *brewing* coffee or just *sipping* coffee, and as of now I’m not really enjoying brewing nor drinking my mediocre morning cups. I definitely love the idea/aesthetic of coffee more than the labor itself.

Anyone have similar (or different) thoughts?

EDIT: A lot of people have informed me that 30 min is too much time for French Press. For clarification, I’ve been using the James Hoffman method in which he recommends 9-12 minutes of total time in which the coffee grounds are in contact with the hot water. I believe you guys when you say that this is probably unnecessarily long. Thank you.",248,616,2019-03-13 10:25:09

What is the most ridiculous barista behavior you've experienced when ordering?,3bimyg,False,True,"We already have the perspective from the barista side, now what about the consumer? Consumers are the only ones who derp it up at the counter, plenty of weird, crazy, stupid barista behavior out there. I'll start with something I posted elsewhere:

This actually happened (I'm looking at you, espresso profeta in westwood):
-barista: hi!
-me: hey, I'll take a double espresso to go.
-barista: we don't do espresso to go, only in a porcelain cup, but if you want it to go, I can make you an Italiano, which is an espresso, then we fill it up with hot water.
-me: uh, I just want the espresso.
-barista: well I'm sorry, I can't do that, would you like the Italiano?
-me: ok sure, give me an Italiano to go, hold the water. Yes?
-barista: that would be an espresso, and I cant do that to go
-me: arghwahrghla YOU GUYS ARE CALLED ESPRESSO PROFETA. IT'S IN YOYR NAME. IT'S THE FIRST ITEM ON THE MENU. THERE'S A STACK OF TO GO CUPS THERE. PUT IT IN ONE OF THOSE AND GIVE IT TO ME NOW.
-dude who had been casually standing behind the counter observing: look, we don't do espresso to go ok?
-me:............... Gah!

It actually went on longer  than that, by which time I could have, of course, slammed the espresso is porcelain, but that's not what I want to do, and there's absolutely no reason not to give it to me in a paper cup. I posted about it at the time on a coffee site, and two things were brought up: 

1) it's by Ucla, and they want to prevent kids ordering an espresso, then going to the milk station and adding a pint of milk for free, for a ghetto latte. Hmm, interesting thought, but a)  I'm a 40yo dude, clearly not a student, and b) go large and spring for some small to go espresso cups and bypass the issue altogether. 

2) they don't want the delicate flavors of the espresso tainted by paper. Uh, their espresso ain't that special, the taste of paper is seriously overstated, and it's my damn choice (as dictated by my schedule, lack of time, etc). 

BTW, I went back more than once and tried. I even took in my own to go cup. They won't do it.

I finally caved and bought an Aeropress,axnx8f,False,True,"Out of all my friends and family, I’m probably the most pretentious about my coffee and where it comes from. Using a French press, buying bags of coffee that are anywhere from $10-$20, making pour overs, but I am nothing compared to you guys. 

I wasn’t even aware that the Aeropress existed until I found this sub and suddenly I found myself questioning my entire coffee drinking existence. Was this $30 gadget really worth it for the best cup of coffee? 

In short, yes it was. I caved a couple days ago and finally bought an Aeropress because I saw one last box sitting on the shelf at Target. *this must be a sign* And after only a couple days of using it I’m convinced I will never have a cup of coffee as good, from home at least. Even my cheap tin of bulk coffee from Costco tastes great when used with it. 

After reading up on the Aeropress a little bit more and experimenting with the grounds to water ratio, I eventually went back to the store and bought an electric milk frother, and now I’m sitting in the comfort of my own home enjoying a lavender flavored latte that tastes as good as almost anything I’ve had from a coffee shop.

We took the seminar in Hannover (Germany) at 24grad. First we did some cupping with 10 coffee beans in total. It was very  interesting to notice the different flavors to develop. Also, the differences between natural and washed coffee have been huge. Afterwards, we chose for a Kenyan coffee to test for the different ways of brewing the coffee. Hario v60 and Aeropress have been favorite of the group but it was quite impressive how big the differences have been between all ways of brewing. It has been a nice guide on which gear to buy. I have been a little under-impressed on clever dripper and cold drip. Kalitta was not that good on the Kenyan bean, too but I will test on middle American beans as next step.

Ice brew method,dfstla,False,True,"I’ve shared this technique I invented a couple of times over the years, but I always like to try and spread it to newcomers in the community by reposting. 

The Japanese have a method of cold brewing called the Kyoto technique. Some trendy coffee shops will use (cool but expensive) drip towers. Basically, one drop of water at a time is dropped onto the coffee grounds, and slowly makes its way through the grounds, producing VERY tasty and strong cold brew coffee. 

Well, for those of us who don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a drip tower, I have a solution! All you have to do is take whatever brewer you use for hot coffee (aeropress, Chemex, pour over apparatus, etc ANYTHING with a filter!) and put your grounds in it. A notable exception would be a French press (sorry). 

Next, literally all you have to do is get ice from your freezer and put it on top of the grounds. The ice melts at a similar rate that water would drip from a fancy drip tower, providing the same gravity-controlled brew rate. 

Now, I PROMISE that this will be done in the morning if you set it up before you go to bed. It’s a much faster process than immersion cold brew coffee! And, I have consistently gotten stronger, less murky coffee than what I would get from immersing identical beans.",244,647,2019-10-09 21:27:58

The Coffee Ritual Finally Clicked For Me,3ihmne,False,True,"I am one of you guys now.

My whole life, I just *liked* coffee in the same way I *like* General Tso's Chicken.  I wouldn't make it myself, and I wouldn't have it every day, but if I had time in the day to kill I would enjoy sitting at a cafe with a book and an espresso or coffee.  It never was something I would go out of my way to get or get cranky about not having (and I'm still not quite at that point yet).  I only know a little bit about coffee and brewing methods and unlike other things I'm into in which I'm very picky, coffee was never one of them.  Is it strong, black, and hot?  Yes.  Is it not burnt rubber?  Even better.  I felt the same way about coffee that I do about rosé: it should be cold (hot) - good is entirely optional.

This all changed earlier this week.  I do not know why exactly, but while I was in a Mediterranean market in my city I purchased an ibrik.  I went to a local coffee shop that roasts their own beans and I purchased a light roast and had it ground to the Turkish consistency (I read that while the brewing method is identical, traditionally the Turkish style prefers dark roasts and Greek/Eastern European style prefers light roasts, so I guess I made Greek coffee).  I watched some videos on youtube that demonstrate the brewing technique.  With a conservative amount of sugar added, I attempted it myself.  I was fully expecting to be let down at my first novice attempt, but the results were shocking to me.

It was the best coffee I had ever had in my life.  I sat down with the coffee, ice water, and Turkish delight.  The whole experience seemed somehow sacred, like some ancient wisdom manifested and jolted me out of the monotonous depression of a working morning.  It was the closest I had ever come to a kind of ""zen"".  This morning I woke up and repeated the whole thing and it was just as awesome as it was the first time.  It sets me in such a better mood for the day, like I have this new calm and objective disposition and all my anxieties settle down.  It's probably just the drugs talking, but I love it nonetheless.  I don't know why I have never experienced coffee this way.

I want to learn more about coffee and different brewing methods, but I feel like I've struck gold with what I've done.  What I make is exactly what I want coffee to be.  I'm still dumbfounded that I have managed to do it successfully because I was worried I would over-boil it or something and make it a bland and muddy mess.  I suppose I'm a natural.

Roasters providing brew instructions for individual coffees is something I would love to see happen more often.,98mqbz,False,True,"Yes, I know that goes against the spirit of experimentation, but let's face it: You don't always want to experiment with that 25 dollar bag of beans! Sometimes you want a reliable cup. Especially if we are talking about 200g of a Geisha, or something similar. 

I've bought coffee from roasters that have info attached to each page. Others, like Blanchards, will even give a brew sheet with each purchase. Some roasters provide little info, and aren't very receptive to inquiry, which kind of leaves the consumer in the dark at that start. That's fine mostly, but for particularly challenging beans to dial in, you may not get that perfect cup until halfway through your bag!

If every bean is different, then roasters should provide info for what works with each individual bean. They have the most experience with the bean to start, access to fancy things like refractomers, etc. They should pass this on to consumers who just want a good cup of coffee. 

And sure, once you have that approach down: Experiment!

so i thought i'd switch things up this morning from my V60 and make a drink with my dusty old AeroPress, inverted of course, because that's just how i like things. everything's fine and dandy, water's boiled, chamber warmed up, filter rinsed, coffee grounded and tossed into the chamber, tared, let's go brew away! i'm excited, because it's been a while since i've played with this buddy. minutes later i give the sludge a nice swirl, get every bit involved, slap my cup over the chamber, do that cool flip thing i look forward to doing everytime and SPLASH, OF COURSE i forgot to screw the filter cap back on and made a hot mess, not my most flattering coffee moment hahah.. for a second there i was wondering how the heck this happened, then noticed my cap sitting there innocently

"My new very simple, repeatable V60 recipe",7y8kv4,False,True,"First, the recipe: 3 equal pours. That's it. Hear me out.

I bought a v60 about 6 months ago after having used almost every other brew device there is (sans siphon and espresso). With it, I've pretty extensively tried the [Perger recipe](https://vimeo.com/46612013), the [4:6 method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCW8xSWGZY) and mostly have used and had great results with the [Rao method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Qe_ASxfNM), which has been my go to mostly. I even was doing an [immersion bloom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/7ry4a2/v60_blooming_in_a_separate_cup/) for a couple weeks which I thought worked well.

A couple weeks ago, I stumbled upon the George Howell [Chemex recipe](http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/brew-guide/chemex-6-cup-for-one/) which doesn't bloom (I understand the first pour is still the off gassing pour) and is just 3 equal pours and decided to try it with my v60.

I do just 3 equal pours. That's it. No stirring. I let the water fully drain between the 1st and 2nd pour, but not fully between the 2nd and 3rd. The first pour doesn't result in a flat bed, but the 2nd two do. Doesn't seem to matter. I've been getting the most consistently great, clean, sweet v-60s with this recipe by far and the simplicity is awesome. I've been using 1 coarser than the Rao recipe on my Encore.

I think this is actually harder to mess up than the 1 pour techniques as with the one pour, if it is a bit slower or faster it exponentially f*cks it up throughout the pour but with the 3 equal pours, there's less room for it to get away or go way too slow (assuming you know how to pour pretty well already).

Try it out. Let me know what you think!

Please help me settle a debate about espresso.,c77mub,False,True,"I will try to make this short and succinct.  My partner and I have an ongoing disagreement about what makes espresso, in fact, espresso.  She has said on numerous occasions that what I make with my machine, Quick Mill Andreja Evo Premium, isn't espresso because they are not espresso roasted beans but rather ""any old bean"".  She worked as a barista for almost 5 years when she was younger, not at a Starbucks (an important distinction to make).  Lately I have been running a light to medium roast Ethiopian Yirg (don't remember how to spell the rest at this current moment) through my espresso machine.  Enter the two sides of the debate.  

Her argument: what I'm making is not espresso because it is not an espresso roasted beans.  In a coffee shop it either wouldn't be served as espresso or would have to be caveated with the information that it is a lighter roast and does not have the espresso flavor profile that is classically known to be espresso.

My argument: espresso is coffee produced by pressing hot water through finely ground and tightly packed coffee grounds at about 9 bars of pressure using a combination of steam and pressure.  I maintain the roast doesn't matter for the definition, only the personal taste preference.  

I also realize that this debate between us is nothing more than bickering because sometimes it's fun.  Tonight she said I'll probably put it on Reddit to be vindicated so here I am.  What say you r/coffee?",238,679,2019-06-29 18:58:11

Thanks to u/theunendingtrek for turning me on to this method. I just want to hear from the rest of you! Are you using this method, what do your pours look like, how is the coffee coming out, etc? 

I have tons of acidity, and I love it, but I want to learn more about the method to get some sweetness in there. I have the numbers I am happy with, but I know you can tweak your pours to alter the flavor.

Ingredients:

2 oz Jameson whiskey

2 tsp turbinado sugar (known to the Irish as “brown sugar”)

6 oz freshly brewed, hot coffee

heavy cream

Directions:

Put a teaspoon into a glass coffee mug (the kind with a stem) and pour some boiling water into it to warm it up. (The spoon is there to reduce the chance that the glass will crack, but be careful!)  Swirl the water around and pour it out.
Pour the whiskey into the glass.
Add the sugar.
Add coffee up to within an inch from the rim.
Stir until all the sugar has dissolved. (The sugar makes the cream float on top, so don’t try to use artificial sweetener.)
Hold the spoon just above the surface of the coffee. Carefully pour the cream onto the spoon. The cream will slowly flow over the edge of the spoon and rest on top of the coffee.  (Now you’ll have a glass of black coffee with a white layer of cream on top.)
Serve the coffee on a plate with NO SPOON.
Drink the coffee through the layer of cream.

Im an Engineer and am not scared of learning complicated machines/processes. I am however obnoxiously busy and dont want to add 20 minutes to my morningly routine.

From doing a little research everyone seems focused on presses and bean grinding. Do presses make a pot or a cup?

In my head the perfect coffee machine would be: Every couple of nights grind fresh beans. The night prior, prep coffee machine. In the morning use wifi to access machine and make a pot of coffee. Go down stairs and have coffee ready vs having to wait for it to be ready.

Pros: Cheap, Grinds Coffee Beans automatically seems simple enough to use \(more important for other member of house\)

Cons: Seems cheaply made, doesnt have wifi control \(not a big deal\), reviewers report say hopper has bean feeding issues and is too tiny.

Pros: Looks like it makes a bomb ass espresso, Heavy Duty.

Cons: Very Expensive for a coffee maker. Probably get stuck in a boujee espresso fandom rabit hole. Does not look quick or easy, Lots of moving parts to fail/  have to teach other people to use \(after i learn\).

Beginner Wall of Text,819rb8,False,True,"**My Understanding of the Basics**

I am putting together my coffee knowledge for my own sake and for the sake of having a post to link to when someone new to the sub/ new to coffee asks, “what’s coffee all about?” In seriousness, I always want to be helpful to people that want to get into high quality coffee, but there’s just so much to say. If someone asks, “Should I grind my own beans to get better coffee?” You must delve into the quality of the bean, the concept of growth regions, the degradation of coffee following a grind, the consistency of grind, the grind size, and suddenly, it’s an intimidating text wall. Okay, so maybe you don’t *have* to go into all that, but I want to. So, I’m going to throw this on here, hopefully not being too long winded, and use it as a reference for when people refuse to read the wiki. I’ll try to include information that isn’t listed there so it’s not 100% redundant, but there will inevitably be redundancies, please don’t throw me out. My goal is to structure this into sections, so I (or anyone) can link to it and say which section to read to answer a question, or even jump in and C/P directly from it in response to a post.

This is geared toward newer brewers, not any one getting into roasting or growing, or even sourcing green beans. Mostly, it is for people that like coffee and haven’t broken fully into the world of specialty beans and brew methods, etc. Some of the knowledge is picked up from experience, some from other people or books, but largely it will go uncited, and if anything is inaccurate, please hit me up so I can get it changed. I’ll throw some references in at the end, but nothing too crazy.

**Getting Started**

How do I start making amazing coffee at home?

Well… It helps to have a healthy budget. Nothing insane, but I don’t have an answer for the “how do I make perfect coffee for a one-time $20 fee” crowd. You will need a brew device of some kind, a scale, a gooseneck kettle, and most importantly, some delicious coffee beans. (See equipment and coffee sections below). You weigh out your coffee, put it in your fancy new (or gently used) grinder, and put hot water to bean and wham, you’re making coffee. Especially in this sub, it can feel like there is a lot more to it than that, but there isn’t. Beyond that, it’s all about making that cup you just made better the next time and the next until it’s perfect, and then being able to do it repeatedly. Consistency and high quality is the name of the game.

If you want to make espresso, expect to spend some money (read, hundreds) on a machine. But quality pour over is attainable for $50-$100, maybe even less if you can get some stuff lightly used. Start with the beans. Then the brewer- probably a V60, Kalita Wave, Aeropress, Chemex, or French Press. Those are the common ones, and there are countless articles out there about the pros and cons of each. An hour or two of Google Fu will get you dialed down to which one to go with, and remember none of them are wrong and they all make great coffee, so you won’t pick a bad one. After you have that, get a grinder, then a scale. Then fall into obsessing about recipes and ratios.

TL; DR: Coffee, Brew device, grinder, scale.

**What is ‘Specialty Coffee’?**

The term “specialty coffee” sounds super pretentious and is probably a turn off to a lot of people who want to drink good coffee but hate that attitude. It’s just a category like “craft beer” that sets it apart from commodity coffee, ‘Commodity Coffee’ being the big brands like Folger’s and Maxwell House. Specialty coffee has a few different definitions and the definition is changing slightly with time, but a good authority to look toward is the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA). Their current working definition is a coffee that scores a Q Test score of 80 or above (see section on quality testing). This relates to uniformity, defects, growth quality, origin, and a slew of other things. Essentially, most of the coffee worth exploring with different brew methods and experimentation fits under the umbrella of ‘Specialty Coffee.’ It is what we discuss in this sub.

It is worth noting that (and will be referred to repeatedly) coffee enthusiasm is all about flavor and enjoyment. If you love Folger’s through a French press, drink it. Don’t let any snobs tell you it’s wrong, because if you like it, then it’s right. You are the ultimate determinate when it comes to the quality of your brew.

TL; DR: It’s a fancy way to say craft coffee.

**Where do I get good coffee?**

Well… Good is qualitative and up for debate. This is the vaguest form of this question I have seen so far, but it’s a frequent one. The answer is also vague and can be frustrating, but it can also be a very fun process. Go drink coffee. That really is the best place to start. You won’t know what kind you want unless you have something to compare it to. Find a local shop that you like, and ask what beans you are drinking. If they tell you “the light roast,” email the owner, because they will either have a better answer or you’ll know to change shops. But I will delve further into that below. Basically, find the region your favorite coffee is from, and what process they used to clean the beans (see the Coffee is a Plant section). For example, I am a huge fan of washed Guatemalan brews, so you talk to Google and either find something local, or just search and buy online. Ultimately, the goal is to get a bag of beans you want to try 2 or 3 days after it’s been roasted. If it takes a week to get to you, it’ll be fine. Still give it a try. Mail order beans are great, local is great, just start buying and trying different coffees. It is worth noting at this point that having a reliable brew recipe will bolster your exploration, however if you’re still getting dialed, don’t fret. There is plenty of time.

Before I totally close out this section, I want to mention ‘light, medium and dark’ roasts. I personally don’t really know what this means. I used to follow this system at Starbucks and places like that, even in grocery stores, but there isn’t really a light-medium-dark system in the specialty world. I mean, yes, you can still roast beans longer or shorter, but for the most part, the roast will be tailored to the bean. Rather than take one bean and roast it three different ways, usually the roaster will decide how long to roast that bean to best utilize its flavor. It’s like a bean specific recipe. So, if you are looking for a specialty “light roast,” go in for something with fruity or floral tasting notes. A dark roast? Something with chocolate, nutty or caramel notes. For the most part, beans will be roasted less- the longer a bean is roasted, the less origin-related flavors remain. This is why so many mass-produced beans are over-roasted, because they can blend beans from all over, roast them to a crisp, and demonstrate consistency. Anyway, that is my cynical side poking through. I have heard that many people find Colombian beans to be the best entry point to specialty coffee because many Colombian roasts don’t have a ton of regional flavors, or rather they are the flavors people are used to in coffee. I don’t know for sure, but maybe a good place to start?

E: u/theefaulted pointed out in the comments that while ""light-medium-dark"" may be ambiguous, there are terms that are useful when it comes to roast level. Terms like City, Full City, and French Roast are well defined (at least in America) and used by roasters to refer to when the beans are removed. When coffee beans are roasted, moisture leaves the beans and the expansion causes a crack- both physically and auditory. This happens at about 385 degrees F and is when the stage considered ""light roast"" begins. The ""second crack"" is where dark roast is considered to begin at around 435 degrees F. Medium roast is the ambiguous place in between the two. City refers to a roast pulled right at the end of the first crack, Full City is right before the second, and French is right after the second. *Chemistry warning* When you roast coffee, it under goes a Maillard reaction. This is the same reaction that results in golden brown toast and bread, and occurs above 285 degrees F (if I remember my chemistry right). This reaction is responsible for ""roasty"" flavors in coffee. Much like toast, you get different levels of this flavor at different heat/ duration during the roasting process. French roast coffee will have a heavily roasted flavor, verging on burnt but still tasteful (if done right), whereas City will be light and retain more of the natural flavors of the coffee, namely some of the fruity and floral notes. Again, these terms are used somewhat frequently in America, and while I am not aware of any other lingo for other nations, referring to the first crack, between cracks, or second crack should still get you where you need to go when discussing beans.

TL; DR: try a bunch 

**Whole Bean or Pre-Ground?**

This one gets a little dicey because you are starting to look at all the different variables we as brewers can control. A disclaimer before we get too into the weeds- Pre-Ground coffee can be delicious, and there are many people that exclusively buy pre-ground coffee. They are not wrong and nor are they in any way lesser coffee enthusiasts because of this act. Again, if it tastes good and you enjoy it, it’s a good cup. That said, there is a reason people in this sub spend entire paychecks on grinders.

As coffee brewers, our entire goal is to remove as little quality from the coffee as possible throughout the brewing process. We are an exclusively negative effect on the beans. There is no brew method or skill that adds something to the coffee that it didn’t already possess. We may evoke certain flavors or combine the coffee with various dairy products that make it more enjoyable, but the roasted coffee bean is what defines the quality of the beverage. This fact makes grind important, as it is one of many variables we can try to control to get a better cup. Even if it doesn’t seem like it, brewing is an exercise in chemistry. Some brew methods look like chemistry sets (i.e. siphons) so maybe that won’t come as a total surprise. Check out the Coffee Chemistry section for more information on that, but for now, it is important to know that the flavor in coffee comes from water soluble molecules that dissolve at different rates from the bean. If your grind size is inconsistent, then the water will penetrate the smaller grinds fully (and extract the flavors more quickly) than the larger grinds, resulting in both over and under extracted flavors (see Brew Time section). Basically, in a perfect world, every coffee ground would be a sphere of the exact same diameter with uniform make-up. This is impossible, but modern grinders get us closer to this than ever before. Some might argue that we have reached a point of diminishing returns where getting the grind more uniform than current top-of-the-line grinders is impractical and that benefits outweigh the costs. Regardless, if you are going to buy whole beans (encouraged) then you are going to want a grinder that will give you consistent sizes. This can be achieved by either a hand grinder or electric grinder. The standard recommendation is a conical burr grinder- this refers to the shape of the burrs, or pieces that crush the coffee bean, as the conical burrs are largely more consistent than a flat blade grinder. You can read more in the equipment section if you so desire, but to get back to the bones of this section, if you want more control over your cup and more opportunity to improve your brew, get a grinder and buy whole bean. If you’re happy with what you get at the local store pre-ground and you aren’t curious or excited about grinding your own beans, don’t spend the money.

**Is brew time really that important?**

Short answer? Yes. I will expound on this a little in this section, but it is mostly a matter for the Coffee Chemistry section.

Brew time is one of the most important variables we as brewers have access to control. It is a means to influence the result of something we can’t directly control- extraction. Extraction refers to using the hot water to extract desirable flavor molecules from the coffee beans. Perfect extraction balances all the flavors to our liking without too much or too little to it. Under extraction is a result of too short a brew time, where over extraction is the result of brewing for too long. Essentially, in the extreme, under extraction will result in tea-like coffee that is basically closer to hot water than the brilliant vibrant cup you were hoping for. Over extraction will taste like 3am IHOP coffee- dirt, soot, bitterness incarnate. So basically, brew time is important, but how do you decide brew time? You can pull an espresso shot in seconds, but a French press takes 4 minutes. Well, it goes back to the previous section- Grind Size. If the grind is large, it takes longer to extract all the molecules because it takes longer for the water to permeate the bean and dissolve the lovely flavors within. To find the right grind size for the method you are using, ask the internet for a recipe and then play around with it from there. Again, coffee is a personal pleasure, so my perfect extraction is different than yours. Rules of thumb- espresso grind (finest) is 20-30 seconds, medium grinds (pour overs) are around 3 minutes, French press (coarse) is 4 minutes. These are gross estimations and should not be taken as gospel. If you grind fine in a pour over, you can still get a great cup in a minute and a half, you can grind coarse and extend it, etc. Just depends.

TL; DR: yes. Brew time is very important.

**The Golden Ratio**

You’ll hear about brew ratio from time to time (read: every other post) and how much impact it has on flavor. Let me tell you here and now, it doesn’t impact it as much as you think. In my opinion, a good place to start is with 1 gram of coffee for every 16 grams of water. For instance, a recipe calling for 25g of coffee would receive 400g of water. Changing this ratio will certainly change the strength of the coffee, and sometimes it will allow more or less flavor to come forward, but it won’t really change the overall profile of the coffee. This variable is more about the strength of the coffee than the flavor. Many people will say I am wrong about this, but I argue that changing the amount of coffee alone doesn’t change the flavor all that much. It can make the water flow faster/ slower and change the extraction time, and that will certainly change the overall flavor. It is hard (probably impossible) to change one without changing the other, so in that regard it does influence flavor, but within reasonable amounts, it is less perceptible than the change in intensity.

* E: It is worth noting that, as u/mastley3 states below, changing the ratio does change the overall flavor, but what I mean by this section is that as a beginner starting out, this variable should be low on the list of concerns. If your cup is coming out bad or even just not quite what you wanted, this variable isn't going to get you there on its own. Once you are truly dialing a recipe in for yourself, and you want to highlight different notes or aspects, then this is a great thing to play with, but for the basics, find a ratio with the right strength and stick to it!

**Brew Method**

Another common question starting out is, “what kind of brewer should I get?” Well, first, you are the brewer. You want to know what brew device to get. Second, that vastly depends on what you are looking for and how deep your pockets are. There are various other gadgets you need (see grind size, brew time, and equipment sections) but you are right in assuming that none of them can make the coffee, at least not as well as the thing you are trying to buy. Let’s venture through the popular ones focusing on single servings of brewed coffee, not espresso. This is not an exhaustive list, but it represents the most popular methods I have seen in the sub and the most common starting points while you get your bearings in this weird world of craft coffee.

* Pour over: I’m starting here because it is one of the most nebulous categories with the most options these days. From the V60, to the Kalita Wave, to the Chemex… there are just tons of models and possibilities. In my opinion, this is the best option for someone starting out that needs a workhorse of a brewer with no moving parts that can make a wide variety of different styles of brew while still consistently giving good cups regardless of skill level. Filter type is going to be very important with these brewers. Cups range from ‘Clean’ to ‘Full-bodied’ depending on your grind, filter, and method. Dense paper cleans out a ton of oils and particulates leaving a clean or clear cup that highlights tasting notes but sacrifices the mouthfeel, acidity, and some aromas. Paper is also disposable, easy to manage, and consistent. Cloth filters introduce a little more oil and particles into the brew, and metal filter let through a ton (in general). If you brew Chemex with a paper filter, you’ll get very clean coffee. Switch to a Kone (metal) filter and suddenly it resembles a French press.

* French Press: This is widely considered one of the easiest brew methods to “master.” Mostly because it consists of pouring coffee and water into a cylinder, stirring, and waiting for a while. Then you push a plunger, pour, and enjoy. While one of the easiest methods, it also only yields one kind of coffee. It is full-bodied and includes all the oils and acids, as well as a sizable number of finer grinds. The mouthfeel is the most potent of common brew methods, and the coffee will be considered “strong” to many starting their craft coffee journey. Don’t get me wrong here, it makes great coffee, but it isn’t for everyone, and even then, it isn’t everyone’s favorite.


* Aeropress: This brew method has a lot of press, both good and bad. There is even an entire World Aeropress Championship, which is a little overblown and ridiculous, but has gotten some great press into the specialty coffee world. This method consists of a single serving-sized cylinder where you pour coffee and water and a large plunger with a rubber seal that, unlike a french press, pushes the coffee through the grounds and out the bottom filter into the cup. There is a lot of versatility in this method, and a wide variety of coffee can be made with it. It is cheap, portable, and low-maintenance, and it’s no wonder it is marketed as a brewer for beginners. To me, the AP is a jack-of-all-trades, and by that virtue, a master of none. Great device, makes great coffee at an attainable price, I’ll always have one in the arsenal.

* E: I left out an alarmingly important note for this section, as pointed out by u/stabbyfrogs below- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER DEVICE YOU GET YOU CLEAN IT REGULARLY. Coffee, as stated multiple times throughout this write-up, contains oils. This means that rinsing your device and throwing it back in the cupboard does not get it clean, because the oils are hydrophobic and water alone will not suffice. The oils that coffee leaves behind will oxidize and will become rancid over time. This will introduce some, shall we say, less than desirable tasting notes to your beverage. Keep it clean out there. This also applies heavily to grinders- there are tablets you can buy to run through your grinder to clean out the oils, just know you'll have to run a good amount of coffee through after them to make sure you don't end up with cleaning tablets in your next cup. I like to use a bag of grocery store beans for this, nothing I intend to drink.

**Non-Brew Device Equipment**

There is a lot you need besides a V60 and hot water to get a recipe dialed in for good coffee. Regardless of the brew method, you will need a good grinder, a kitchen scale and a good kettle. Let’s cover each in turn:

* Scale: You don’t need anything fancy. Just accurate (preferably with the AWS, or American Weigh Standard, Seal if you are in America) and perhaps with a timer. Make sure it measures in grams or a similar sized unit. Remember, measuring coffee beans, they are light. Hario makes a fine scale specifically for brewers that has a timer and scale included, as well as a pour over stand, and I don’t recommend it one bit because it is 42 freaking dollars. That is preposterous. Grab a ten-dollar scale and use your phone timer. Goodness. At any rate, accurate weights of both coffee and water are necessary for a good, consistent recipe.

* Kettle: This is another easy one- get a gooseneck kettle. It is better if you can get a variable, programable temperature kettle, but they are more expensive. A stove top or electric kettle of any kind will do, but the gooseneck will really help with a consistent pour for those pour overs which results in a good, consistent cup.

* Grinder: this topic is far too large for any introduction. In short, you want something that produces consistent grinds. Whether that be a Lido or Porlex (elbow-grease powered) or a wonderful Baratza, you’ll always be shocked at how expensive they are and even more shocked at how there is always room to improve. A great starting point is a Hario Skerton- it’s affordable, they sell them at target, and it’s a relatively consistent conical burr grinder. Unfortunately, because it is manufactured in such a way as to make it affordable, the stem has a little play in it, so when grinding you must be very conscious to keep your turn in a flat circle (I.e. not pulling or pushing too hard on the handle). It takes a little technique, but it is a great starting point. E: keep your grinder clean with tablets. See brewing method section edit for more on this.

That’s really it for other equipment. There is a lot of other stuff that is nice to have, but you’ll get there later.

TL; DR: Get a good scale, grinder, and kettle for your rig.

**Coffee is a Plant**

This section is rarely referenced in questions, but it is worth knowing and understanding that coffee is, indeed, a plant. Or rather, it comes from a plant. Coffee beans are the pits of cherries from a shrub that thrives at 1800-3600 ft. of altitude in tropical climates with well-defined rainy and dry seasons. The cherries are picked and the fruit is removed from them, then the beans are considered “green.” They are then roasted and turned into the wonderful beverage we all enjoy. The way the fruit is removed is often referred to as the “Process” or the removal process. There is a washed bean where a machine washed away the fruit, which some perceive to give a cleaner flavor. Then, there’s the natural/ dried/ sun dried process where beans are left out for the fruit to kind of dry out and fall off (at around 11% moisture content if you’re curious), which can let more of the cherry’s flavors into the beans. The flavor of the bean is influenced a good amount by the process, which is why most specialty roasters will list the process on the bag with the other prominent information such as locale and tasting notes.

TL; DR: coffee comes from cherries, and we dissolve the pits into water and drink it. Yum.

**Coffee Chemistry**

One thing that I particularly like to nerd out about is flavor. First and foremost because that is the part of coffee that makes it so darn enjoyable, and secondly because it has the most science behind it. The flavor of coffee comes from the plant, the region, the process and the brew method/ recipe. Everything about coffee comes into play when you’re talking about flavor. During the brewing process, water extracts the delicious flavors imparted to the bean during growth, processing, and roasting. The way in which this happens is particularly interesting (or terribly boring, depends on the person) in how much chemistry is truly involved. I am no expert, but I will explain it in a way that makes sense to me. Each chemical compound in the coffee bean is water soluble (dissolves in water) and adds its own flavor to the final cup. Caffeine, acids, lipids, etc are all compounds that provide tasting notes. When brewing, the brew temperature, duration, grind size/ consistency are all key because of this dissolving process. During the early moments of the brew, only light, short molecule chains are getting dissolved into the water, providing floral and citrusy notes to the coffee. Then, during the middle of the brew, chocolaty and caramel like notes are present. During the final phase, the smoky and pleasantly bitter flavors arrive, as the longest desirable chains of molecules. If you are practiced and a little bit lucky, you will cut your brew off with the perfect amount of each of these, and you won’t go any farther into the burnt, rubber, ashy flavors that lay beyond.

There is a ton more to the chemistry of it, and if you find it interesting, I encourage you to do some research and read up on it. Extraction rations, caffeine content, regional variances, all very interesting to the science-minded and obsessive folks around the sub, but maybe not intro-level stuff I should get too far into here.

TL; DR: we are all mad scientists here.

**Quality Testing**

Coffee quality is a subjective field. Defining “good” coffee is like defining a good burger, or good beer. That said however, there are people who train their palettes specifically to judge the quality of coffee. So called Q Tasters dedicate hundreds of hours and undergo many tests to become a certified judge of coffee, and endure periodic tests thereafter to ensure their palettes have not decayed or desensitized in any way. If it sounds pretentious, it’s because it kind of is. These are the coffee experts. Much like sommeliers, they taste things in coffee you wouldn’t even think to look for. They judge aromas and flavors in a practice called cupping, which is sort of like a pure brew method. Coffee is put into a mug and hot water is poured in, basically as purely coffee as you can get. The coffee is then slurped from a spoon and, in theory, anything the coffee has to give will be present and detectable in that moment to a Q Taster. They rank the coffee on a 0-100 scale, and anything above 80 gets the SCAA seal of approval as specialty coffee. Coffees with a score of 95 and higher are rare and might cost a bit to try. Most of the coffee we wax poetic about in this sub scores between 85 and 95 if I had to spitball.

TL; DR: professional coffee nerd is, in fact, a plausible career path.

**PSA about Water**

Coffee is mostly water. It stands to reason that any undesirable flavors or minerals in the water will be detrimental to the final brew quality. There are ways to combat this, but some are better than others. You can get distilled water, but then some minerals in water ARE desirable, so you typically must add something like Third Wave Water (google) to it to get it right. Regular spring water is great too. I have fantastic water where I live coming right out of the tap, so I use that. But not everywhere can boast such high-quality water tables below them. If you have off flavors and use tap water thinking boiling it will fix it, change your process. Rule of thumb- if the tap water tastes weird on its own, the flavor will make it into the coffee.

* E: Basically, when you are starting out, my rule of thumb for you would be this- if the water taste fine on its own, it will taste fine in your coffee. Once you start dialing in your recipe, and when you are really gunning for consistency, you should absolutely look at water as a variable. Until then, get some that you're okay with and work on the rest of it. When you are looking that way, u/solidbrain made a book suggestion for this in the comments- [Water for Coffee](https://waterforcoffeebook.com/) is a book outlining the importance of water quality and mineral content for good and consistent coffee. If you fall far enough down the coffee rabbit hole, it will inevitably come up. The book is currently sold out of the first edition (as of March 2018) but will be in print for the second edition before summer for those interested.

**Cold Brew**

I don't know shit about cold brew, and I honestly don't prefer it if hot coffee is available. Apologies for the hole in my knowledge.

**References**

The Coffee Compass can be used when there is a problem with your coffee that you just can’t seem to fix. It lets you know if you need more or less coffee, or more or less water.

The Coffee Taster’s Flavor Wheel is a great resource for putting words to the flavors of coffee and allowing coffee nuts to speak a common tongue. It is by no means a comprehensive diagram, but it does a really good job of separating the light, middle and heavy flavors that can be present in coffee, and showing how over and under extraction can result in nasty coffee.

Specialty Coffee in Vietnam: Impressions & Highlights,da0g1q,False,True,"I recently got back from a two-week stay in Vietnam, where I split time between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. I made a point to explore the coffee culture with a particular focus on the burgeoning specialty coffee industry. Much has already been written about the development of specialty coffee in Vietnam, but a lot has happened in just the past few years that made my visit particularly interesting.

Vietnam has a significant place in coffee history. It is the world's second-largest producer, but about 97% of the output is Robusta and sold to companies like Nestle ([source](https://sprudge.com/interview-will-frith-43112.html), [source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-07/world-craving-for-vietnam-s-robusta-coffee-has-exports-surging)). Vietnamese people also consume a tremendous volume of coffee ([source](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/vietnam-s-caffeine-thirst-puts-it-in-world-s-top-growing-coffee-markets-3549858.html)), which is obvious to anyone who has visited and seen the countless coffee shops that dot the streets. These shops are mainly community-oriented places with long hours that serve Robusta prepared in traditional ways. Specialty Arabica coffee--characterized by its broad flavor profiles, newfangled brewing techniques, and higher costs--remains largely a novelty.

The purpose of this post is not to judge or criticize the existing coffee industry in Vietnam, but to provide some insight to those with similar tastes and interests. Below are my impressions of six specialty coffee shops that I visited.

**Hanoi**

* *Ella Specialty Cafe Roaster*: This cafe, located about 1km from where I stayed in Quang An, was my introduction to specialty coffee in Vietnam. The chalkboard sign out front proudly depicts a Diedrich roaster and various specialty brewing equipment. Inside the space is like a high-end version of IKEA. Notably, it appears to be entirely women-owned. I had a V60 of a single-origin from Risaralda, Colombia, which was brewed extremely carefully and had a pleasantly orangey profile, but was slightly baked. The place features awesome views of West Lake and the baristas were outgoing and clearly excited about what they were doing, although they noted to me that the place (less than a year old) had so far mainly appealed to foreigners.
* *Kafeville*: This is an oasis on an otherwise not terribly appealing street in Ba Dinh. I stopped in during an accidentally long walk on a scorching-hot day and, in an out-of-character moment, ordered the cold brew. It was very good: single-origin Colombian served in a tiny flip-top bottle, and the roast level imparted the round chocolate notes that I enjoy in cold brew. They also roast their own beans on a small machine that I didn't recognize, located right in the front of the shop. Like every other specialty shop I tried in Hanoi, they offer Robusta along with Arabica and prepare it as espresso with or without sweetened condensed milk. My SO got it with milk (""nua"" or ""white"") and it was pretty striking: earthy, woody, grassy flavors really stood out. A nice ""study"" in Robusta.
* *Blackbird*: This cafe served the best coffee I had in Hanoi. It's located on a busy street in the Old Quarter and was absolutely packed when we arrived in the late morning. The space is structured like a large cube, and there's a balcony that provides additional seating and an excellent view of the space. A key feature is that they only serve Vietnamese coffee--both Robusta and Arabica. I had a V60 of a Catimor grown on Langbiang Mountain in Dalat at 1650masl. This coffee was well-developed but there was hardly any hint of roast, which let the coffee speak for itself. It was delicious: delicate, citrusy, with good complexity and sweetness. I enjoyed it so much I then got an espresso--also Catimor, roasted medium, and pulled on a Victoria Arduino Black Eagle, it was velvety in texture although not particularly interesting. The manager was friendly and knowledgable, and he explained that, while challenging, high-quality Arabica production in Vietnam is possible because there is sufficient elevation in certain areas like Dalat. My SO again got a Robusta (natural, grown in Gia Lai, 450masl), white, and it was also the best I had in Hanoi: super rich and chocolaty but balanced and not too muddy in flavor.
* *Atelier Coffee Roaster*: Sleek, low-key spot in Ba Dinh. The counters are strewn with specialty coffee gear, including a wide array of pour-over devices. A bit unfortunately, my relatively expensive pour-over of a washed coffee from Kiambu, Kenya, was prepared using a Wilfa Svart rather than the EK 43 sitting a few feet away. The coffee, roasted by Just Bean Roastery (although Atelier roasts their own coffee too), was still good: bright, fruity, and obviously Kenyan, but a bit thin and under-extracted due to the very coarse grind. Once again, the brewer took great care weighing, pouring, timing, and even tasting a small sample before serving it to me. My SO's Robusta with milk was intense and rich with lots of earthiness. The cafe was extremely calm and practically empty at 9:30AM, when the owners were putzing around, organizing chairs and lighting incense, but started to fill up later in the morning. This place also happens to be a couple hundred meters from Anh Hoa Bakery, which is one of the best French-style bakeries in Hanoi.

**Ho Chi Minh City**

* *The Workshop*: This is the oldest and most famous specialty shop in HCMC. It's on the third floor of an old walk-up building in District 1 that features massive windows and high, vaulted ceilings. This was also the busiest and most self-assured place I went. They roast all their own coffee (both imported and domestic) and utilize pretty much every brewing device you can think of. My SO and I split a ""large"" pour-over of a washed Caturra/Catuai blend from Tarrazu, Costa Rica, that was brewed in an all-copper V60 setup. Lots of ripe citrus intermingled with assertive dark chocolate that was brought out by the slight roastiness of it. It was quite enjoyable, though at 135K VND it was disappointingly tiny--no more than 10 or 11oz total. The whole place feels much more Westernized than anywhere else I went; the tables are filled with fashionably dressed young people on their phones and laptops, and the baristas are not particularly interested in chatting.
* *Shin Coffee*: Also in District 1 and extremely close to Workshop, this shop is smaller and features a more eclectic, Pier 1 vibe. Cool and calm with two levels of seating and wall-to-wall shelves full of coffee paraphernalia, including a Q Robusta Grader certificate. They roast all their own coffee on two tiny sample roasters and one slightly larger one, and they offer various blends as well as seasonal single-origins. I got a V60 of the ""Shin blend,"" which is an all-Arabica combination of coffees from Vietnam, Africa, and Central America. It had lots of nuttiness with a bit of citrus and good complexity and sweetness despite the elevated roast, and it was served in a bone China cup and saucer with gold-leaf decals. My SO got the super-decadent egg coffee (more like a coffee mousse).

Other places that baristas recommended that I did not visit include Acid 8 (Hanoi), Tranquil Books & Coffee (Hanoi), Cotero (Hanoi), The Berry Field (Hanoi), Red Door (HCMC), Bosgaurus Coffee (HCMC), La Viet (HCMC), and Saigon Coffee Roastery (HCMC). Several of these places are just a few months old.

Prices generally ranged from 55,000-80,000 VND for a 8-10oz pour-over (so about 2.40-3.50 USD). For reference, that's about 2-4x as expensive as traditional Vietnamese coffee. Yes, portions in Vietnam are rather small compared to the US.

Overall, I was most impressed with the very high level of care and attention proprietors are putting into new specialty cafes and roasteries in Vietnam. Every staff member I spoke to was clearly passionate about what they were doing, in addition to being warm and polite. This contrasted a bit with my experiences in certain specialty cafes here in the US. Every pour-over I ordered was prepared extremely carefully with (mostly) proper equipment, although techniques, and results, varied considerably.

In terms of the coffee itself, I would say there is significant room for growth. Many of the roasters are sourcing high-quality green coffee but, at least to my palate, struggling a bit with roasting. Of course what I view as flaws may be intentional. Moreover, lots of other coffee cultures around the world gravitate toward darker roasts. But there can be lots of subtlety and artistry in darker roasts too, and more than a few times the coffee I had was noticeably ashy. (This week I've been drinking Irving Farm's house blend, which is squarely medium and absolutely phenomenal. With so much depth, complexity, and sweetness at a significantly elevated roast level, it's basically a case study in how to develop darker roasts.)

It is also hard not to notice that, at this stage, a significant fraction--perhaps a majority--of the customers at the specialty shops are foreigners. This isn't very surprising; the specialty stuff is much more expensive and contrasts starkly with what millions of Vietnamese people have been drinking all their lives. But as in other countries, there's a core of baristas and roasters dedicated to changing the way others view and experience coffee. There is clearly great potential in Vietnam for producing, roasting, and serving top-quality specialty coffee, and I'm excited to see what happens next.",232,705,2019-09-27 06:31:07

One look at my office coffee setup this morning suddenly has me questioning if I'm in the right line of work,84n94m,False,True,"https://imgur.com/xOTxMdi

I wish I had this much passion for my actual job! I'm really glad to have discovered my love for coffee and I'm sure it will stick with me for life, but sometimes I wonder if there is a way I could turn that passion into a profession. 

I come from a pretty entrepreneurial family (both my brothers have successfully built their own companies) but I feel like I lack the ambition and drive they have. I've been roasting my own coffee for awhile now and I love it, but the more I look into it the more I realize what a saturated market coffee actually is. Just trying to think of a name for my coffee that isn't already taken has been a challenge.

The other challenge is that I have a growing family to support; if I were on my own I'd for sure feel more compelled to take financial risks; but at this stage in my life it seems unwise.

How about those of you who work in coffee? At what point did you know it was meant to be your livelihood? Perhaps at some point even if I don't make a career out of it I will be able to carve out a side gig, whether that's in roasting or just working as a barista in a local shop.

EDIT: **Thank you** to those of you who have taken the time to respond with your experience and insight (and TIA to those who have yet to share); I've gleaned some valuable advice and information and I hope it serves to help others who find themselves in a similar predicament. The coffee community is truly a special one!",233,707,2018-03-15 08:21:19

I promised then that I'd share the results when the project was finished. Life kind of blew up in my face after that, but I'm back! Thanks for all the input, /u/Anomander,  /u/gotteric, /u/_FormerFarmer, /u/paosnes, /u/bbobeckyj, /u/Josh18293, /u/assingfortrouble, /u/ElectricNed, /u/SmirkingImperialist, /u/minibeardeath, /u/jorsiem, /u/Drews232, /u/ajandl, /u/OccamsRazer, /u/phinicota, /u/evenextraction.

**tl;dr:** I studied the effect of four basic coffee-brewing factors (water temp, coffee/water ratio, brew time, grind size) on extraction of dissolved solids in the brew, as measured using a homebrewer's Brix refractometer. Results showed that coffee/water ratio was overwhelmingly most significant factor. There were some bumps along the way.

The following long post is excerpted from my report, lightly edited and rearranged for this format/audience. I'm happy to answer questions if you have any, but remember I did this writing 6 months ago, so the results and thought processes are not fresh in my mind. Also note that this was for an introduction to experimental design, and our instructor intended the actual experiment more as a ""proof of concept"" than as professional-quality scientific inquiry.

# Coffee Extraction as a Response to Factors in Brewing

by NinlyOne, 1 August 2018

# Response Variable: Extraction

Extraction refers to the measure of total dissolved solids (TDS) transferred from the coffee beans to the coffee solution during the brewing process. In recent years, there has been increased interest among coffee connoisseurs about the appropriate level of extraction in a brew, but little to no formal analysis of how factors in brewing technique affect the extraction response. Therefore, the experiments reported here explore how the factors described above manifest in the extraction level of the brew.

Extraction was measured with a refractometer designed for beer homebrewers to use in measuring the sugar content (specific gravity) of wort prior to fermentation.

Recent years have seen a number of digital refractometers introduced specifically for the coffee market. These units boast much greater precision, however they also cost several hundred dollars. Meanwhile, a number of coffee enthusiasts (including Alan Adler, inventor of the AeroPress used in this study, among other products) have used devices like this with successful results. Given the tight focus and replication of the first experiment, I felt that this inexpensive alternative was an acceptable option.

The refractometer is marked in scales of specific gravity and a unit known as °Brix. Brix is a measure of sugar content of an aqueous solution, and scales linearly with refractive index. The relevant dissolved solids in a coffee solution are not only or even primarily sugars, but because of this simple linear scaling factor (an affine transform, which should not affect our coded analysis), for convenience I employed the Brix scale directly, and left the response in those units for analysis.

# Choice of Factors

The four factors for this study are Water Temperature (A), Coffee-to-Water Ratio (B), Brew Time (C), and Grind Size (D). Each was tested at both of two discrete levels.

**Water Temperature (A)**

Coffee is typically brewed using hot water in a range near about 200 °F, with variation in practice depending on brewing method and taste. Temperature is one of the more tightly controlled variables among professional and competitive baristas. For this trial I chose the values of 170 °F and straight-off-the-boil (approx 210 °F), coded as -1 and +1, respectively.

**Coffee-to-Water Ratio (B)**

It’s not an uncommon question: How much ground coffee should one use? Among enthusiasts, this variable is normally discussed as a weight ratio of coffee to water. Many specialty coffee tutorials recommend a ratio of about 1:17 as a good starting place, with a wide range of variation from there, depending on brewing method and personal taste.

This trial employed the extreme ratios of 1:30 and 1:10, coded as -1 and +1, respectively. These ratios were realized in measured masses of 6.7 grams and 20 grams of dry coffee beans, weighed prior to grinding. A constant volume of 200 milliliters of water was used for all runs.

**Brew Time (C)**

Some brewing methods, including French Press and the inverted AeroPress method used here, involve a “static” time during which coffee is allowed to steep before being filtered or otherwise mechanically removed from the beverage served. The amount of time allowed for steeping affects the strength of the beverage.

This trial employed brew times of 30 and 120 seconds, coded as -1 and +1, respectively, and measured from the moment the heated water touched the ground coffee. I poured the water as consistently as possible to complete the pour in 15 seconds. I began pressing the AeroPress just as the stopwatch reached the the alotted brew time, and strove to complete it consistently in 20 seconds, regardless of the other factor levels.

**Grind Size (D)**

The more finely coffee bean is ground, the more surface area it presents to the water during brewing. Generally a finer grind produces a stronger beverage.

This study employed a Baratza Encore conical burr grinder set to 20 (for a coarse grind) and 10 (for a fine grind), coded as -1 and +1, respectively.

**Note**

It is worth noting that these levels were not chosen to produce a fine cup of coffee—or even a drinkable one! Extreme levels were selected to maximize use of the refractometer's measurement range.

# Experimental Design

This project involved two experiments, the design of each described below.

**Experiment 1: 2****^(4)** **Full Factorial Design**

My initial intention was to do a fully randomized, unblocked 24 factorial experiment with three replicates. Unfortunately, my refractometer failed about two-thirds of the way through this trial, necessitating replacement of the unit before study could continue. One consequence of this was that a blocking factor was added post hoc to analysis of Experiment 1, for fear that the two devices might yield different results.

**Experiment 2: 2****^(4-1)** **Half-Factorial Design**

A second experiment ran a fully randomized, unblocked 2^(4-1) half-factorial treatment. Unlike Experiment 1, however, this trial involved only one replicate—this was another unfortunate consequence of having to order and wait for a replacement for the failed refractometer; only a small amount of time could be set aside to run the second experiment, which did not allow for another three-replicate trial. On the bright side, this allowed for exploration of the design-reduction techniques discussed in class.

# Performing the Experiments

For each run, I brewed coffee with an AeroPress coffee maker using the “inverted” technique to help control brew time consistency. Whole, fresh single-origin beans were used from a recently purchased bag.

For both trials, a consistent procedure was established and followed for each run: The brewing area and apparatus were cleaned, the coffee beans were weighed and ground at the appropriate levels for the coming run, the water was heated in an electric kettle to the appropriate level, and the coffee was carefully poured and timed before manually activating the AeroPress to obtain a sample cup. A portion of the resulting brew was allowed to cool for a few minutes while the apparatus was cleaned and prepared for the next run, and finally a refractometry measurement was collected and recorded for subsequent analysis. After a few runs, this routine was established and very few difficulties were encountered in collecting consistent results.

# Statistical Analysis

**Experiment 1: Initial Analysis**

A surprising number of main effects and interactions demonstrate significance, as illustrated in the normal plot for these data, given in [Figure 1](https://imgur.com/a/TcnKwHt). Far and away, the most significant factor is the main effect of B, coffee-to-water ratio. Put simply, the more dry coffee is used per cup, the more extraction—an intuitive result.

All of the other main effects demonstrate significance, as well as the second-order interactions *Temperature\*Ratio*, *Time\*Ratio*, and *Temperature\*Time*. The significant negative effect of the fourth-order interaction, along with that of *Temperature\*Time*, is interesting, as well. This may express a situation where nearly all solids available for extraction have been dissolved in solution (effectively depleted from the ground coffee), resulting in lower response than modeled by regression.

Notably the blocking factor managed to avoid significance at the 5% level, with p=0.085. However, the probable effect of the shift to the new refractometer is visible in analysis of residuals, and is discussed below.

**Assumptions and a Consideration of Blocks**

Residual plots are shown in [Figure 2](https://imgur.com/a/TcnKwHt).

Overall, residuals raise very little concern about ANOVA assumptions, though a slight increase in variance at the lower end of the fitted values is consistent with expected difficulty in controlling the coffee-to-water ratio at the -1 level. This is because small variations in either coffee weight or water volume cause greater variations in the associated ratio than they would at the +1 level.

Although potentially a random effect from the ANOVA perspective, noticeable and interesting shifts appear in the plot of residuals versus order, corresponding with blocks. Beginning at run 31, consistently positive residuals lead to run 39, which is where the refractometer failed. This sequence may demonstrate the point over which the unit began to fail.

Runs 39–48 represent block 2, measured using a brand-new refractometer: these values are more consistent with the fitted model than any others (over time) in the experiment. Based on this alone, I was tempted to re-run the complete 2^(4) trial with the new refractometer—unfortunately time does not permit!

**Experiment 2: Initial Analysis**

Because Experiment 2 involved only one replicate, no degrees of freedom are available for estimating error. Therefore, Minitab's effects analysis (using α=0.1) is used to assess which of the model terms is least significant. These terms are discarded from the model and rolled into the error term for a more complete ANOVA and residual analysis.

The D and AD terms are identified as least significant and discarded, leaving a three-factor hierarchical model for full analysis. A normal plot summarizing the results of analyzing this reduced model is given in [Figure 3](https://imgur.com/a/TcnKwHt).

As in Experiment 1, the ratio of coffee to water (factor B) is overwhelmingly the most significant effect. With model reduction, we also observe a significant effect of water temperature (factor A) at the 5% level. Brew time (C) and interaction Temperature\*Ratio (AB) are close behind, but without the additional power provided by replication, this design is unable to determine further significance.

**Checking Assumptions**

Residual Plots for the reduced half-factorial design are shown in [Figure 4](https://imgur.com/a/TcnKwHt). They show no cause for concern about ANOVA assumptions.

# Conclusions

The most prominent conclusion of this study is that the amount of ground dry coffee used in brewing is the main factor in determining the extraction response in brewed coffee. Experiment 1 also confirmed that all three of the other chosen factors are relevant to extraction, as well as a number of interaction terms. Experiment 2 underlines the primary conclusion of Experiment 1—that coffee-to-water is the primary factor—but results disagreed otherwise. Many main effects and interactions were not detected in Experiment 2, and the only main effect that was significant (water temperature) was ranked last in significance among main effects in Experiment 1.

# Recommendations and Lessons Learned

The biggest lesson from this experience was an applied reminder of Hofstadter’s Law:

*It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.*

That is, I tried to allow plenty of time for what I considered the ambitious goal of running three replicates, but the unforeseen failure of the first refractometer encroached on the time needed to run replicates in Experiment 2. I suspect this detracts from the potential effectiveness of the half-factorial design—advance planning for more replicates of the smaller, aliased design, rather than the gargantuan full factorial, would clearly have been a more sane and effective approach. There is no way to be sure based on current data, but I suspect that even a second replicate would greatly improve the veracity of the second trial’s results, and possibly lead to analytical results more consistent with those of Experiment 1.

This also proved a valuable exercise in factor leveling. The extreme significance of Factor B relative to the other main effects indicates that I chose levels that were rather too extreme. Especially given the potential for control issues with the lower level of that factor (see discussion of assumptions for Experiment 1, above), ratios much closer to realistic values (say, 1:25 and 1:16) would likely have produced results no less robust, but better balanced, than those reported.

As mentioned above, extraction alone is but one of several complex components in the qualitative assessment of a cup of coffee. Water temperature, for example, is understood by connoisseurs to determine which flavor compounds are extracted from the bean and how those flavors are changed during the brewing process. Further exploration of the many factors and responses relevant to coffee flavor is recommended.",228,711,2019-01-01 23:14:01

"Coffee shop ""etiquette"" or just jerky manifesto?",3nhtpp,False,True,"So I went to a coffee shop lately that I've been wanting to try for a while near my parents house.

I got a flat white there, it was fine; not great, not terrible (it was bigger than I was used to, filled a whole 12oz travel cup).


The first thing that I didn't like is when my dad asked for a mug, since he likes drinking cappuccinos from a ceramic mug rather than travel cups if he is sitting in, is the owner of the shop came up and told him ""you're lucky, you're gonna get the last of the mugs since I don't want to do anymore dishes.""

"With a little help from r/Coffee, I'm finally making good pour-overs with my V60 on a consistent basis",dcb08g,False,True,"For the past few months I've been struggling to make a repeatedly good cup of coffee with my Hario V60. For every 5 cups I'd brew, two would be undrinkable, one would be great, and the last two turned out just OK. I read through all the posts regarding different methods, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, and I watched all of the video tutorials, from James Hoffman’s ‘Ultimate V60 Method’ to Tetsu Kasuya’s 4:6 method, and after learning a few things about grind size, water temp, and pour technique, and making the right adjustments, I think I’m finally making pour-over on par with local coffee shops.

Having said that, I’d like to share with you all my recipe for a V60 and get your opinions on what you think about it. As you’ll notice in my instructions, I’ve taken elements from Hoffman’s method and incorporated them into the 4:6 method and I really think it works well with the lighter roasted coffees I generally go for:

1. Start off with 20g freshly roasted coffee (ideally less than 2 weeks from roast date) to 300g filtered water (205-208°F or right off boil)
2. Grind coffee medium-fine,  ̶a̶b̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶a̶r̶s̶e̶n̶e̶s̶s̶ slightly coarser than what Hoffman recommends for his technique
3. Rinse paper filter in V60, pre heat brewer, discard water from carafe.
4. Optional: Put the kettle back on stovetop after rinsing paper filter to bring water back to boil
5. Pour in coffee, make a well with your finger in the coffee bed
6. Start timer and gently pour 2x coffee dose as water to bloom for 45 seconds (up to 3x coffee dose if needed)
7. Swirl your brewer to make sure the water and coffee are evenly mixed
8. At 45 seconds pour enough water in small concentric circles until scale reads 120g
9. Pour 60g water @ 1:30 (180g total)
10. Pour 60g water @ 2:15 (240g total)
11. Pour 60g water @ 3:00 (300g final weight;  drawdown completes @ 3:30)

Note: water should completely drain between each pour. If it doesn’t you might want to go a bit coarser on your grind.  

Note 2: You will also notice in this method that your coffee bed will not be flat in the end. Even though Hofmann and others stress that the bed should be flat, Tetsu has mentioned that it is not necessary for his method.

I hope some of you will try this method out and tell me if it works for you as well.

Beanboozled? Roaster took my money but never shipped,bs31yc,False,True,"Hey guys,

Sorry for the cheesy title, I couldn't help myself.

Anyways, about 3 months ago I started a sales job with crazy hours. I started turning to coffee to help get me up in the morning. Because of an experience long ago at a food awards ceremony, I knew that coffee was more than just Folgers.

&#x200B;

I got my own grinder and a really cool drip machine that has a slower setting to get that bloom. I've been watching the subreddit for good bean recommendations and honestly you guys have never let me down. I also recently had a child and money has been very tight so when I ordered some Finca Inmaculada from Archetype coffee and it never arrived I was a little upset.

&#x200B;

Has anyone else had problems with Archetype? I made the order on 3/30/19 and I got an order confirmation and shipping confirmation. The tracking number shows a page that says the shipping label was created 4/1/19 but they are still awaiting the item.

&#x200B;

They have no number to call, both their coffee locations have no numbers listed and the only way to contact them is through a form on their website. I have sent in two forms, I emailed their support a few times too but never heard anything back... I'm a little at a loss for words... and beans...

&#x200B;

If anyone has some recommendations please let me know....

&#x200B;

EDIT: I was able to get into contact with Archetype, aparently everything had been shipped out but me and one other person had their coffee lost along the way. They have another batch roasting soon and I'm going to get a replacement! I also want to thank everyone who offered to send me some beans as well! I love y'all!",224,756,2019-05-23 06:38:19
"The grinder hype is real, folks.",bplivv,False,True,"So, short story. I went Through the following stages of coffee.

* I like coffee, I'll buy a Keurig.
* These pods are bad for earth, lets use them sparingly and use a reusable pod. Starbucks Pike Place is nice :-)
* The kuerig is nice, but for lots of people, lets get a french press and a grinder (blade) you know, for company.
* Wow this Pike Place is great in the French Press, I want one for work.
* I am sick of grinding beans at home, I'll get a cheap hand grinder on Amazon (Polrex Mini Knockoff) for the office.

Then I found this sub, I upgraded my life and got an aeropress to take to and from work, and found a **few local roasters** (after trying bean box). Things were going okay, but the 3-5 min it took me to grind 17-20g of coffee through that junk grinder sucked. Eventually the plastic in the grinder started to shred and the burrs were cracking. So I tossed it and resided to grinding beans at home in the blade grinder and bring them to the office each day for the aeropress. Not ideal but I wasn't wasting money on a cheap grinder again. Plus, to be honest, the grind quality wasnt *that* different between the blade and the cheap burr. the burr had less fines, but just as many boulders, and since the aeropress is forgiving, it was always a passable cup.

I had my heart set on the helor 101, but randomly changed course, pulled the trigger, and got an ~~m57~~ m47 Traveler from prima coffee. 

Well, first im dumb. I thought the grind adjustment was only a single turn. Turned the dial from being burr locked to 3, threw some starbucks beans we had lying around from a christmas gift in (im not wasting good beans on a trial grind) and nothing came out... wtf.... so i turn it to 5. nothing. so i turn it to 9, and holy smokes i could have pressed what came out into a makeup tin.... it was literal powder... woah. So realizing I had to turn the dial over a few times I got the coarseness I usually aimed for in the past. I shook the junk beans out, loaded in 18 grams of the good stuff, and was SHOCKED when the hoper quit grinding.... ""Its already done? what? that was faster than the electric blade grinder! (I pulse). What!?!?"" So I threw it in the inverted aeropress, added water just off boil, fill the press half way, one minute bloom/brew, stir, fill to the top and wait another minute, cap it and and press it. 

Unbelievable. I literally cannot believe it. If this wasn't the same bag of beans, I would have assumed I got a crazy good batch. I cannot believe the amount of flavor this just created. What even is this.... 

HANDS DOWN the best cup of joe I have ever had. IN-SANE. The ease of grinding, the speed of grinding, the smoothness. The coffee, all of it. Assuming this grinder lasts me 5 years at least, it will be the best $230 I have ever spent. Just wow.

Edit.... thinking about getting a 3 cup Chemex for the office now. This rabbit hole is worse than r/mk

Coffee Facts #1!,5m0ak8,False,True,"*Some Interesting Coffee Facts! If anyone finds evidence that goes against anything I say here, please let me know so that I can make appropriate edits. I don't want to spreading incorrect information!*

**Useful/Interesting Coffee Numbers and Facts**

1.	Water cannot get over 100°C *(it immediately evaporates at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure)*. This is why the “Wait 2 minutes after boil” trick is so consistent in reaching appropriate extraction temperature *(typically 96°C -98°C)*.  *Depending on where you are in the world and your altitude, the atmospheric pressure will change, and thus so will your boiling point. IE: Water boils at 95°C in Denver* **EDIT:** Apparently you CAN heat water up (and possibly beyond) 105°C at standard atmospheric pressure. This is called [superheating](http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/jw/superheating.htm), and can be done in a microwave if your mug/bowl has an extremely smooth surface so that bubbles cannot stick.

2.	1 gram of water equals 1ml of water, but only at 4°C! At room temp [(20°C)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=density+of+water+at+20+c) 1ml of water will weigh 0.9982g's.

3.	Desired/Maximum density when tamping your portafilter doesn’t take very much pressure. People debate anywhere from 8lbs to 30lbs. *(8lb's being sufficient, 30lb's being maximum density)*
4.	Coffee is 100% delicious.
5.	By mass, aprox. 18-22% of coffee dissolves during a normal brewing process.
6.	Espresso typically uses 9 Bars of pressure during extraction. 9 Bars is equivalent to 9 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level, or 130.534 PSI *(pounds per square inch)*
7.	At 9 Bars of pressure, the boiling point of water becomes approximately 175°C.
8.	Modern pump-style Espresso Machines heat water for extraction anywhere from 90°C  to 96°C.
9.	Ground coffee ~~goes stale~~  “degases” *(loses 99% of its CO2)* after 12-24 hours *(at room temp)*, even in an air-tight jar. **EDIT:** *degassing does not mean the beans are stale, that is whole seperate issue.*
10.	Whole Beans will take 7-9 days to achieve the same level of C02 degassing, in the same conditions.
11.	For every 10°C in temperature drop, the degassing time will roughly double. *(I cannot re-find this article to fact check, but the study was posted on here on r/coffee last year. If anyone can find it please pm me!)*

~~12.	Because of #11, storing coffee in a fridge or freezer can be very beneficial. You must however be careful when removing it from said storage that the container remains sealed until the beans and brought back to room temperature, or else condensation/moisture will form on the beans. * **EDIT:** There might be downsides to storing in the freezer, but none that I can find scientific evidence for.* **EDIT**: I guess this is still more controversial than I thought... Feel free to form your own opinion about this one, it has both its ups and downs!~~
**EDIT:** Removed #12 because degassing is not the same as going stale/bad. There are other reasons for this, which once I learn more about, will likely make it into #2!

First Time Making Japanese Iced Coffee,8lt7oy,False,True,"And it's amazing. The flavor is so much brighter than any other iced coffee or cold brew I've ever had.

Beans: Happy Mug Extroverted Tanzania

Total draw down time was about 2 minutes, which is less than the 2:20 I've seen recommended for Japanese iced coffee so I'll try tightening up the grind a notch next time, although I'm not too concerned since the end result was great.

After the pour over I swirled around the carafe until the ice was pretty much gone, then poured into a glass over 90 more grams of ice for a total of 450g of water/ice to 27g of coffee.

You have a metal pot like a very basic water kettle. Put your water in there often measuring it with the cups you are going to serve in. Take it to a boil. Then you drop very coarsely ground coffee in there (you can buy pre-ground with that grind in the grocery store). Take it to a boil again but then taking it off the heat. Let it steep for about 4-5 minutes and stir. Then you just pour it in cups and serve.

The coffee this makes is a very soft rounded quite pleasant coffee actually. But it takes away all the complexity the bean has ever had. But it is soft and pleasant.

I asked multiple roasters what they thought the ultimate goal of a great cup of coffee would be.,4e37in,False,True,"Heads up: This is an extremely long post... I was honestly just really curious to see how similar/different each roaster would approach answering such a simple yet infinitely complex question. I asked if they thought a great cup of coffee ultimately relies on the extraction yield % and/or TDS or water temp., etc. Just thought I'd post it for anyone who... well... is bored and feels like reading something, I guess.

Response from **Sterling Coffee Roasters**

That's a great question and one the entire industry is at odds about. Although the SCAA Golden Cup standards have established both strength and extraction yield parameters for some time, it's only recently that ExtractMojo software and refractometers allowed coffee companies to easily measure both and adjust their brewing parameters.

That said, I'm not convinced that extraction yield is a very helpful concept, and in some cases I think it's poorly understood because it's not clearly defined. Even worse, very fine measurements of extraction yield are often used to recommend very expensive changes to equipment and procedures (including consultancy to establish those procedures) which may not be justified by the degree to which they improve retail coffee quality. As is typical in other cases, many people understand the relationship (fines don't taste good, boiling water makes coffee bitter, etc) but then use that general relationship to justify specific parameters (extraction yield should be 21% not 18%!!, water should be 200° not 202°!! etc). 

To answer your question more directly: I think a great cup of coffee depends on several qualities which each have a certain natural tolerance or range. First, the green coffee must be scored 87 points or higher (how much higher doesn't seem to matter that much). Second, the roasted coffee must be heated past first crack but not past second crack (how close to first or second is a matter of taste and/or brewing preference). Third, the grind must not contain too many fine particles or it will taste ashy, dry, and sometimes bitter (how few fines are necessary is up to taste, just coarsen the grind until those defect flavors are removed). Fourth, the water should be hot but not boiling (195-205 seems about right). Fifth, the contact time should be less than 4:00 (significantly less for finer grinds like espresso, which is closer to 0:30).  Sixth, some effort must be made to control the relationship between how much coffee and water is used (a TDS of 1.35-1.45% is generally right but you could also just shoot for bubbles that are between white and deep red in color).  Last, the coffee must be from a country you like (most folks love Central America, some love Africa more than anything, and a few prefer the Pacific Islands).

I hope those criteria don't sound too general; my goal was to provide what I see as the framework within which quality decisions are made. Some tolerance for preference and (*gasp*) indiscernible differences should be made.

That's just my opinion, though. For a beautiful summary of a much more demanding and occasionally opaque way of thinking about coffee check out Ben Kaminski's Why Your Espresso Sucks on YouTube. 

Best,

Adam 

Response from **Blue Bottle**

Thanks for reaching out! Those are great questions. As it sounds like you know, there's many different factors to making a great cup of coffee. The yield % and the TDS are very important as is the brewing ratio, the age of the coffee, and the brewing method. When it comes down to it though, a great cup of coffee is mostly dependent on each person's individual taste preferences. 

With the pour over method, for example, I find that the most important aspects are the ratio of coffee to water and the brew time. TDS is important but is not always an indicator of a good cup of coffee.

Adam

Response from **Stumptown**

The end goal in brewing any cup of coffee would depend on the coffee itself. Our goal in roasting is to bring a coffee to just the right level where its inherent flavors are best expressed. That is why many of our coffees fall into the light-roast range. Similarly, in brewing a cup of coffee your ""ideal"" extraction will depend on the flavors you expect to find in the cup. For our Ethiopia Duromina for example, we would look to bring out notes of citrus and melon in our brewing process. You know you've nailed it with that coffee when the resulting cup reminds you a bit of candied citrus, with a sweet, balanced acidity. 

A tool like a refractometer is great for aiding you in achieving consistency from brew to brew. If you brew a coffee that you love, knowing the resulting TDS measurement can help you better achieve that result again, but the TDS itself should not be the end goal. 

There is a post on our website that goes into this in more detail, you can check it out here: https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/our-story#tasting. There is a great quote on that page from on of our head roasters: ""Drinking coffee is a pleasure. Coffee drinking is fun, and it feels good, and every once in awhile I remember that we’re actually cultivating pleasure. Why do you put anything in your mouth? Because it’s delicious.”

I hope we've adequately answered your question, let us know if you need anything else!

Response from **Roseline Coffee Roasters**

for me personally, and i would imagine most coffee professionals, the single most important factor is repeat ability. in other words making the same coffee every day, whether it be your morning ritual or afternoon pick up.  TDS is a wonderful tool if you are measuring the consistency from cafe to cafe in a chain like setting.  an example would be stumptown regulating their brewed coffee coast to coast, cafe to cafe to insure the same cup at every cafe.  another example would be barista, a local chain.  they test their coffee TDS weekly at every store for consistency.

are you having issues brewing? are you unhappy with your cup quality?  have you ever taken a brewing class or visited http://www.brewmethods.com/  this is a grerat website but you can also get lost.  i suggest you find the method you are currently brewing and check out the videos from a pool of great roasters.  you may also want to check stumptown to see if they have classes as well as clive coffee and nossa familia coffee roasters.  these would be geared towards the home brewer.

Response from **Rob Hoos**

For me, the perfect cup of coffee is all about taste. TDS meters and refractometers (especially in combination with a brew control chart and or software package that simulates a brew control chart) are very helpful tools, but the coffee has to taste right too. For me personally, I prefer our coffees on our water to be brewed around 15.5::1, with asolubles concentration between 1.25-1.35 and a soluble yield of around 18%-19%. All that being said I prefer coffee that is higher in acidity, floral notes, and more tea-like structure (which doesn't necessarily make sense with the high solubles in concentration, but that's where I am at). However other people prefer more balance, and others still prefer the balance to shift toward a higher solubles yield.

The truth is, though there is no perfect coffee, or perfect extraction. Only a range in which a particular coffee with the particular water, and a particular roast profile tastes good.

This sub made me enjoy my first cup of straight black coffee,96u8ac,False,True,"My daily coffee for the past year has been walmart pre-ground medium roast coffee on a french press. Nothing to complain about really and usually enjoy it with about 2 oz of milk.

After lurking this sub I added a Ceramic Kalita to my Amazon wish list. My wife got it for me as a surprise gift.

Today I got some filters, a Mr. Coffee grinder, and some local full city roast coffee beans that I found at Sprouts.

I was scared that full city roast would be too ""bitter"" since my ignorance always led me to believe that dark roasts were bitter by nature and that is just the type of flavor people enjoyed. Got this idea from my experience with dark roasts on coffee drippers. Nonetheless I put my trust on this community and bought the full city roast.

The coffee was oily and shiny, I don't know if that is good or bad but I have never seen that in coffee. It stuck to the grinder walls.

I followed Tim Wendelboe method with a scale and a timer, didn't have a gooseneck kettle but managed to do a fair job with a standard water kettle.

I waited a few minutes for it to have a drinkable temperature. Tasted it and I was amazed. I could distinguish the roast flavor and tones without any bitterness, it wasn't sour. To my palate it was plain and smooth in a positive way. Definitely the best straight black coffe I've ever had besides some coffee shop cold brews I've had.

I wanted to thank this sub!,7n3aum,False,True,"This morning my life changed. 

I have been on this sub reading, asking questions and in general trying to educate myself to improving my coffee experience. This began when I was trying to do clean eating and someone said that black coffee is good for it. I have always enjoyed ""coffee drinks"" from starbucks but couldn't believe that black coffee could actually be good. I was willing to be proven wrong, and bought a blade grinder to try 'fresh ground' and didn't enjoy the result of putting that in my Keurig. I wasn't ready to quit though.

Over the following year, I started to go to the local coffee shops. This area is very delightful for local fresh and quality coffee, there are more places that serve locally roasted coffee than Starbucks. I stopped going to starbucks and started trying these places. Then I started to research to do my own home brews, and fell down a rabbit hole. I spent the past several months coming up with a good setup that would not just be a good intro into coffee but that I could do some really decent growth with as I progressed. Here is what I ended up with.

* Grinder - Breville Smart Grinder Pro
* Kettle - Stagg EKG
* Brew Method - Hario V60 (given to me by MIL, I had not yet researched what pour over method I wanted)
* Scale - Etekcity 
* Storage - Coffee Gator Canister
* Extra - Cuisinart Espresso Machine (EM100)
* Beans - Counter Culture Calca (I live near a Training Center and went to one of the weekly Tastings they offer) 

This morning I did my first pour over and even with all the little mistakes I made (biggest being the scale auto offed while in between pours), my coffee this morning was wonderful. This was my first step in a journey I am excited to be going on. I owe so much to this sub and the wonderful contributors that gave a lot of great information to start me in a solid direction. 

The next step in my journey is to track everything and experiment with different grinds, temperatures, ratios and see what I like. 

I will look into different pour over options and pick out the ideal French Press soon. 

I am going to share my Coffee Station that my husband has been excited to help me set up, simply because he likes the aesthetic (he doesn't even like coffee). Let me know what you think. 

Special shout out to my husband who got me the grinder, beautiful zwilling mugs and the stagg for Christmas. Best Husband Ever!!

Just want to say thanks to the sub,bwaxeb,False,True,"When i started following this sub i thought i had a good grasp on coffee and what goes into making a good cup. What's followed is an overwhelming amount of knowledge, great advice, and positivity. I've drank coffee all my life, but rarely went further than using a few weeks too old beans in a dingy moka pot that i bought years ago. It served me well enough, but this sub opened up the possibilities so much.

&#x200B;

I bought an encore and started freshly grinding my beans, which made a huge difference!. That only compounded further when i started trying different specialty roasters. I grew up drinking bustelo on almost a daily basis when i lived at home because that's just what we drank. You guys showed me how valuable it could be to try different beans, even if you arent sure you'll like them (ive been on a parlor coffee kick the past few weeks). You showed me how to appreciate the process and work that goes into making great beans. Which also brings me to my next point; you helped also appreciate the brewing process so much more. I bought an encore, bought a kalita, bought a gooseneck kettle and scale. I practiced and practiced different pour over methods, until now where i actually feel pretty confident that i could make a good cup of coffee. Or rather, i feel that even when i make a bad cup of coffee, i feel confident knowing where i went wrong, and how i could better it. I find myself waking up earlier now so i could make coffee at home in the morning to just sit and appreciate it. it's completely changed my day.

&#x200B;

So jea, this has been a roundabout way of saying thanks to the sub. I look forward to learning more from you guys everyday.",216,816,2019-06-03 06:55:49

Weed grinder significantly improved my coffee,as0m2f,False,True,"**Pictures**

* [Weed grinder coffee](https://youtu.be/8zqdFY4Gkgw) (different take from above pictures)
* [Javapresse grinder coffee](https://youtu.be/Phy3LZxkMzo)

I got the idea of this from the OE Apex grinder, which is geared toward medium-coarse grinds [(the grind consistency is incredible)](https://youtu.be/o5RVpHCL4Xc?t=62). It uses what's called [crushing burrs or ghost burrs](https://youtu.be/o5RVpHCL4Xc?t=71). The grinding technique seemed quite similar to that of standard weed grinders, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

The weed grinder produced noticeably less fines than my Javapresse (or some ripoff of it, I don't know). This could also be noticed by looking at the finished grinds where there would typically be a sheet of fines coating the top. Admittedly, I'm not sure if I will keep grinding with my weed grinder, because it took some elbow grease and quite a lot of time as my grinder has a pretty low capacity. It was taking maybe 1.15g of coffee at a time.

I had been on the fence about shelling out for a proper grinder, but now I'm sold. Ordered an Aergrind and will be comparing it to my gold standard weed grinder when it arrives.

Edit: Added videos.

Edit 2: Slightly surprised by the fair amount of negative sentiment toward weed. Marijuana was maybe ""cool"" when it was illegal in all of North America, but that's aside from the point. It's not really so different from coffee - people don't generally do it to be ""cool"". People do it because there are many facets (the smell of unsmoked bud, the taste of the smoke which varies depending on how you choose to smoke it, etc) to be discovered through genetic engineering, careful cultivation, processing, and method of consumption. Even apart from the high, there's enough complexity to weed that it wouldn't surprise me to see it being had and sold like cigars in the near future.",214,818,2019-02-18 10:57:32

I would love some feedback from any and all about how to turn this around. I'm currently a salaried employee and I willingly work at least 100 hours a week. The burnout will be strong in this one..",214,849,2018-04-18 19:29:19

First Time with an AeroPress: I am Now a Coffee Person,6adhlf,False,True,"So, a bit of background.  I am 37 years old, and I have never liked coffee all that much.  I never *hated* it really, but if I ever went to a coffee shop(rarely, and almost always because a friend wanted to go), I'd usually either get tea or something loaded with cream and sugar.  Outside of coffee shops, the best I've had is Folgers in a drip coffeemaker.  Otherwise, I usually just drink soda for my caffeine fix.  But I've decided to cut back on my sugar intake recently, and that means I needed an alternative source for my caffeine.  So I ordered an Aeropress, which just arrived today.

Since I have no experience with choosing coffee at all, I just picked something at random from the store:  Hawaiian Isles Kona Vanilla Macadamia All Purpose Grind.  I *mostly* followed the inverted method I found on /r/AeroPress, with two deviations.  I don't have an easy way of heating water(no stove; only a Japanese electric skillet), but I *do* have a thermostat on my hot water heater that goes to 75 C, so that's the(presumed accurate) temperature of water I made my coffee with.  As an added bonus, this both is a great temp to drink a beverage at without risk of burning, *and* it appeals to my innate sense of laziness.  One less step between me and my drink.  The other deviation is that I did not dilute the resultant brew. 

So how did it go?  Well, I'm certainly not going to be in the market for creamer, that's for sure.  The flavor was a lot smoother than I expected, without any of the bitterness that I was accustomed to.  It pretty much tasted like I would expect it to if I had smelled coffee beans and had never tasted coffee before.  I'm actually trying to resist brewing another cup right away(and remember, I didn't even *like* coffee before now).  All in all, I'm calling this experiment a huge success, and I'm looking forward to trying out different beans in the future for comparison.

This is certainly going to make quitting sodas a lot easier.",211,851,2017-05-10 08:30:52

What I regret and don't regret buying,9ei4bg,False,True,"As a coffee lover, you know you have a myriad of tools and equipment to buy. And in the voyage to find  what's perfect for you, you end up buying a lot of stuff you don't use. At least that's what's happened to me.

I'm not near the end of my voyage, and will still buy a lot of coffee related stuff. But in the meantime, I thought to share what I have bought and regret it (not necessarily because is bad, but it just isn't for me) and what I bought and use it every single time.

**Regrets:**

* Kruve - I was really excited with the Kruve. I thought it would be a game changer for me. But in reality, didn't find that much difference on the end result. And its a little messy to clean up.
* Hario Skerton - I don't know exactly why I bought a hand grinder. Maybe I thought I would take it away on travel. Which I never did. And at home it's so much simpler to just use the electric grinder. Even bought a mod to stabilize it a little more on coarser grinds. But still, it may be useful when the electric grinder fail or I have no energy but still want some coffee.
* Handground - Yup, I ended up buying two hand grinders. I like the Handground better than the Skerton. I grind faster and easier with it. But I don't think the results are so uniform. I think it grinds on the coarser side. I never use it past number 3. But I rarely use it.
* French Press - this must be my least used coffee gear. I just don't care for the end coffee it makes. Still, I might use it occasionally for cold brew.
* Moka Pot - rarely use it.
* Thermometer - I thought I would use it every time. In the end, didn't find much use in it. 

**Love it:**

* Hario Scale - use it every single time. I'm lost without a scale. It's essential for getting your brews right every single time. Cannot recommend it more.
* Electric Grinder (Capresso Inifity) - use it every single time also. I know it's not a very good grinder. But it was one of the first gear I bought and have served me well. Also, don't live in the US, so even an entry level Baratza its too expensive. But it is on my list of things to buy.
* Bonavita electric kettle (0.5L) - I bought this thinking on taking on travels also. Only did once. But where I use it most is at home. It heats up really fast. I use it to heat the water, then transfer it to the hario gooseneck.
* Hario Gooseneck Kettle - another gear I use it every day. I cannot pour water without a gooseneck anymore. Unfortunately I once forgot it on the stove, so now it is stained beyond repair.
* Hario V60 - use it to brew almost everyday.
* Aeropress - the one I love the most
* Kalita Wave - I bought the 185 instead of the 155. I usually only brew for one. Don't use it every time, only when I'm doing a little more coffee. But I really like the results.
* Drippo - Love it for cold brew. Its fast to set up and to clean. And it only take about 4h to brew. It is my go to for cold brew.
* Cold Bruer - Use to use it more often. It takes a little more time to prep it and clean it. The good thing is it make for a larger batch, and you can set the dripping to your liking.
* Airscape Canister - use it to store my beans.
* Mason Jar - use to store beans when I already have some on the airscape, and to do some cold brew sometimes.

Well, this is what I can remember. I may have some other minor stuff, but this would be the bulk of it.

So, on the list of things to buy is a Baratza. a Kalita 155, Fellow Kettle, Fellow Duo, FreshRoast Home Roaster and probably will be a lot of other things.

What about you guys. What do you love/regret buying?

"Thanks, /r/coffee! You may have saved my life.",41no5m,False,True,"So a little over a month ago, I had a financial emergency that followed a serious head injury, and posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/3z7yoq/thoughts_on_bad_bean/) on /r/coffee. 

I just wanted to follow up and say that, in the past month plus that I've been stuck at home, not able to do much of anything, making coffee became an essential part of my day, and is part of what kept me going.

My routine basically consisted of trying to get up by 10:00am (which I often failed to do), making a cup of coffee, trying to make breakfast, and then figuring out what I was going to do for the rest of the day until I went to sleep at around 10:00pm.

Some days, the only thing that got me out of bed was the knowledge that today I was going to tinker with my Aeropress brewing, or if I was having a particularly bad day, the knowledge that all I had to do to make coffee was grind it, throw it in my Moka Pot, and wait.

Other days, when I was stuck in a state of confusion and disorder, going through the routine of making coffee helped to pull me back together.

Then, when the bills started piling up, and I had to stop making fresh roasted coffee, making coffee every day, even if I didn't drink it, helped me keep it together. 

**TL;DR: I suffered a serious head injury and making coffee every day helped me get through the recovery.**

So, thank you /r/coffee. You, and your coffee knowledge, helped me persevere when faced with injury. Someday soon, I hope to be brewing fresh, locally roasted coffee again!",206,874,2016-01-19 00:22:35

On the second to last weekend of the month, my family embarks upon an appliance maintenance bonanza.

Various brushes? Got um. Disassembling the Virtuoso is not hard and after brushing everything down and being pretty satisfied with the work, I grabbed the canned air for a final few blasts. You know how sometimes there is a burst of condensed liquid from whatever chemicals they use in those things? Well there was a lot. Weird. Turning the blue can with white label around I felt my heart stop. It was garage door grease...

That crap doesn't come out. Numerous attempts to flush it, remove it, dry it, and it still was producing a weird residue and flavor in anything I tossed into the grinder to purge it. It is definitely not food safe so we erred on the side of caution and bid our Virtuoso, grease laden and slick, good bye.

I was given the most amazing coffee but have no idea how it was made!,8uabka,False,True,"To keep it short, I tutor a Syrian girl and every time I'm at her place, her mother makes me the most AMAZING coffee, and I cannot figure out what she does. All she ever asked me was if I take milk or sugar. I said ""both"", but never specified, and she somehow wizarded me a perfect ratio. I tried to ask how they make it, but their German isn't good enough to explain it. 
Description:

The cups are smaller. The texture is creamy and the flavour is nearly chocolaty and mildly sour. The colour is more of an orange-gold colour than brown. 

She normally serves it with a glass of water and some sort of treat. 

I looked up Turkish and Greek coffee and tried to make those, but it never works. Most recipes tell me there's no milk, but she used milk.  I tried grinding Arabic roasted coffee beans with cloves and a small amount of cardamom. I tried without cardamom as well. I've tried allowing water to boil and tried not allowing it to boil. I've tried adding milk with the water, using only milk, adding the milk after its done boiling, etc. No idea where I'm going wrong. Also, the coffee they give me has no foam and no grounds at the bottom of the cup, as is always mentioned in Greek and Turkish recipes.

Any help would be appreciated!

Edit: to add, when I asked how she made it or if it was with a machine or press, she only could express that it was not either of those things.

Edit: Just met with her. She laughed and was happy to show me her secret haha. Its a very fine ground and mild Turkish coffee (so not strong as most websites told me), in combination with a small spoon of sugar and evaporated milk.

This company has just earned a life-time customer,1b2r9w,False,True,"I'd say that at least one third of all posts on this sub are about equipment recommendations and I want to share my experience with a popular grinder manufacturer that I had literally 10 minutes ago. Actually, calling them just a ""grinder manufacturer"" doesn't give them justice. After my experience I would call them relationship builders, customer service experts, technical consultants, cool ass dudes, or **Baratza** for short. 


Recently my Baratza Preciso was grinding too coarsely. After some hasty self diagnosing I decided that I needed to re-calibrate the machine. So I went on their website and looked up one of their troubleshooting manuals. I tried to follow it to the letter but I'm an idiot and accidentally tore the adjustment ring flat off the machine. 

For a split second I thought, ""No, it's ok. I can reattach that."" But then I heard that gut wrenching sound of tiny loose plastic bouncing on top of my table. 

Fuck.

In last ditch effort, I call up Baratza and got Colin. All you need to know about Colin is that he's awesome. 

After talking for five minutes we both agreed I fucked up somewhere and this whole thing was my fault. Not two seconds later he says, ""So I'm going to send you a new grinder"".

No more questions asked. Did I mention my grinder was refurbished? And now he's sending me a new one? What?

Pinch me I must be dreaming. 

Colin and I wax nostalgically about what it feels like to not have your morning coffee and then pleasantly part ways. 

Not ten minutes later I received an e-mail from Colin telling him my grinder will ship tonight and that I will find a pre-paid shipping label to send back ""my defective grinder"" (even though we all know what's really defective here...&#3232;\_&#3232;
)

Now, I'm sorry if this is a long winded but I really want r/coffee to know that Baratza is more than just a grinder manufacturer. In a world of call centers, disclaimers, and limited warranties, Baratza stands above the rest. Through their altruism and concern for the fellow coffee enthusiast they have gained a customer for life. I will never, so long as I live, purchase a grinder from another company. 

Thank you, Baratza. And thank you, Colin. 

Edit: One more thing. Colin, if you're listening. Next time I will call before I go all vigilante justice on my grinder's ass.

Coffee is not medicine.,21cxd3,False,True,"  Ok, first, just a little background; I hate coffee.

  My entire life, I have always hated coffee; well, until just rather recently.
 
  I can boil my dislike of coffee to one single, pivotal event when I was about eight years old, and to this day I can remember it very vividly. It was very traumatic event to eight year old me and is forever etched into my childhood memories.

  It was a large cup of [Maxwell House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_House) instant; I can distinctly remember the blue metal can it came in, with the picture of the white cup that had the red stripe on it. I was forced to sit at my grandmother’s kitchen table; she had a red/white checked plastic tablecloth protector that had been on the table since way before I was born, it was marked with circular coffee cup stains and holes from cigarette burns across the exposed areas. I don’t specifically remember what the particular ailment was that I was suffering from, sore throat, cough, stuffy nose, or perhaps just a slight touch of the plague; I have completely blocked and repressed that particular aspect out of my memory.

  Evidently though, the old world cure for it was cold coffee. 

  I sat there at my grandmothers table for what seemed like an eternity, slowly sipping a cold, bitter, brewed concoction from a thick, heavy, dark brown ceramic coffee mug. The mug was kind of a two tone pattern, with a light cream colored glaze around the rim. I suppose it was meant to evoke and mimic the image of a delicious cup of coffee, topped with frothy cream goodness? The mug walls were about an inch and a half thick and the entire thing weighed about twelve pounds in my hands. Every sip was an agonizing mouth full of suck and elicited tears and pleadings that I felt better already, and didn’t need to drink any more, but alas, all of my begging fell on deaf ears. I was forced to finish the entire cup, right down to the fine coffee sediments settled in the bottom of the cup. Needless to say, it was NOT ""Good to the last drop"".

  So, I have spent my entire life practically coffeeless, almost forty years free from the horrid taste that first cup of coffee indelibly etched on to my young, impressionable mind. Now, I must admit, I did like the smell of coffee and I do like “coffee flavored” things like candy, cake and Java Monster drinks. The random cup of coffee that I would have every now and again (I could probably count the number of them on my hands, with fingers left over) would be so loaded up with sugar and artificial creamer that any semblance to actual coffee was completely driven from it.

  So, about a year and a half ago and for no apparent reason, I got a hankering for a Keurig machine. Don’t really know why, for some reason unknown to me I subconsciously decided that I was going to learn to like coffee, and not knowing a single thing about making it, fell in love with the thought of being able to make a single cup of it merely by putting a little sealed cup into a self contained machine. I absolutely knew that I would not drink a lot of it, and I did not want to have to bother with big jugs of freeze dried coffee and percolators and coffee pots and such, just for a single cup of coffee once or twice a year. The Keurig machine was brilliant and I fell in love with the concept of it.

  The following is a rough timeline of my descent into coffee anarchy…

+ 22 OCT 12 Asked for and received a Kuerig coffee machine as a wedding gift.
+ 7 NOV 12 Grew disillusioned with the packaged K-cups.
+ 3 JAN 13 Purchased reusable K-cup filters and pre ground coffee at grocery store.

+ 12 DEC 13 Purchased 3 cup Bodums French Press for wife (for tea) at mall.
+ 8 JAN 14 Purchased 8 cup Bodums French Press for me (for coffee) at grocery store.
+ 7 MAR 14 Purchased the absolute most awesome cup of coffee I have ever tasted in my entire life at [thirty-thirty coffee](http://www.thirty-thirtycoffee.com/) in Peoria, IL. It was a 16oz.

How fast is the process from coffee drinker to grind fanatic?,ciz3p3,False,True,"I'm a black coffee drinker. I enjoy a great cup but have never considered myself fussy. I just buy Traders Joe's ground coffee because that's convenient and economical and it tastes fine. Why get snobby about a cup of joe, when it can be basic or fancy but unites us all in a morning quest for happiness.

So I snagged a blade grinder for $5 at a neighbor's garage sale. Just figured that was a nice 'try me' price. I understand the difference between it and a good burr grinder. But after a couple of weeks I just can't stand a brew from preground. I made a cup with preground and gave it to my mom just now, and told her the rest of the bag is hers. I ground fresh for myself. I can now taste the lack of freshness, lack of oils, lack of mmmmmmmm. I looked at that cup and just couldn't drink it. I love my mom, but she puts a gallon of milk in her coffee so she doesn't care 🤭

How soon before this blade grinder is tossed away like training wheels? What happens to me now? I'm not buying a $200 burr grinder right now, I've got other things I need. Someone tell me what happens now!",199,899,2019-07-28 11:04:51
Just made my best Aeropress by accident,axc0at,False,True,"Hi there guys
I'm writing this post while drinking what to me is the best Aeropress that I've ever made. Apparently my brother just used my baratza encore in the setting 19 or 20 to make a French press and as usual I grabbed my coffee beans (beans from Ethiopia roasted by La Cabra Coffee Roasters) and forgot to change the setting (usually I go for a setting around 10-14 it depends). 
So I just noticed that the grind size was to large and I've decided to make an inverted Aeropress, 15g of course coffee with 200 g of water (84 C). I added all the water, gave it a nice swirl and waited 3 minutes before inverting. Pushing the press was also quite strange for me, since the grind was quite course I pressed it to hard and went really quickly down. So two accidents that resulted in a really nice cup, maybe just try it and give me your opinions

What little things do you appreciate during your coffee ritual?,8nczpm,False,True,"I'm fairly new to coffee but I started using a v60 for the past several months and I LOVE IT.  While the coffee is wonderful, I think what I love more is the ritual of it.  Starting off my day by nailing the intimate process of extraction gets me feeling oh so good, and then to sit down and quietly sip the result...  OK so I might be on a coffee buzz right now, but what do you girls and guys enjoy most about your coffee ritual?  Here are a few things I enjoy:  

- Getting the grounds perfectly flat, then pouring gently in a perfectly spirally motion and getting all the grounds wet . 
- When you pour right in the middle, the foam (not sure what it's called) is a lighter color than the residual foam from the previous pour, so I like pouring right on that edge between light/dark and watching the light foam reach the edges . 
- Watching the water drain, revealing that interestingly textured flat bed of grounds . 
- That initial sip indicating that you just brewed a fantastic cup of coffee

Japanese Iced... Espresso??,6jay0p,False,True,"So I was recently struck with an idea that I tried and ended up loving. I was thinking about Japanese Style Iced Coffee, where you brew directly over ice to immediately cool the coffee and preserve the bright flavors without oxidation of cooling coffee by other methods. I wondered if the same principle could be applied to pulled espresso shots. 

So I took two large ice cubes, rinsed and drained them in a 4.5 oz cortado glass, then put that in the freezer to stay cold while I prepped the shot. ~18g grounds in, ~40g doppio pulled over the chilled cortado glass and ice. For reference, I'm grinding with the Baratza Vario and using a Crossland CC1 V1.5 to pull the shot. 

I have to say, I have a new favorite drink for the moment. The ice dilutes the shot a bit when it's pulled, but not so much that it's watery. The bright complex acidities and flavor notes of the espresso remained intact, and I actually think the fact that it's cold helps you taste other notes a little more. I sipped at it along with some chilled seltzer, and it was the most refreshing afternoon pick me up I've had in a long time. In fact it was so good I had another, my fifth coffee for the day. 

Has anyone else tried anything like this? I tried looking it up but all the results were about people trying to order iced shots so they could make ""ghetto lattes"" at Starbucks or whatever with the store-provided milk and sugar.

I finally got the perfect Japanese Iced Coffee with my V60 after weeks of adjustments!,505ou1,False,True,"As I type this, I am drinking the best tasting iced coffee I've ever had in my life. My mouth actually is getting sore from smiling. I bought a V60 01 size to go with my Hario Skerton and I purchased a Hario Gooseneck as well, probably about a month ago, maybe 5 weeks.

From that day, I tried each morning and occasionally in the evenings to make the perfect Japanese Iced Coffee (JIC). I got better with each cup, no doubt. But a local place in my city makes JIC at the coffee shop and there's was always better than mine.

Today however, making the grind size a tiny bit finer, allowing 5 more seconds for bloom, and pouring slower on the brew water... I tasted the first coffee hand made by me that is better than what I can get at a coffee shop.

I am so happy right now!

If anyone is curious, here's my recipe:

15g coffee, medium light roast, slightly finer than table salt

155g of water, 50g for bloom wait 35 seconds, 105g very slowly

130g of ice, in large cubes. not crushed

Water temp at 196 F

When I got her to taste it, she got completely baffled by the difference and that it was only due to a change of grind size. This time, she really enjoyed it and even asked me multiple times if it really were the same beans I used the previous time.

Recently, when making myself cups of V60 I've noticed that if I stir it a couple of times - not only directly after completing a brew, but during drinking it as well - it really tastes better, each sip is more pleasurable and more fruity.

The thing that has made all the difference in my v60 technique,67j9vv,False,True,"So I've noticed pourovers are really different from place to place, but there is one shop near me that is consistently head and shoulders above the other specialty places in the city. Whenever I order one I watch how they do it, and all the baristas there do something I've never seen before.

There's always been a bit of a debate over whether you stir it or not during the bloom. But what these guys do is reach a teaspoon right down to the tip of the filter and pull all the coffee up, then give the whole slurry a couple of quick stirs so it evens out again. Then single pour the rest as usual.

Since I've been doing this at home my pourovers have gone from 8/10 to 10/10 almost every time. I was always told to stir just to make sure all the grounds are wet, mainly thinking about blobs of dry grounds around the edges. But I didn't realize that the biggest such blob is in the tip of the filter. Pulling it up and mixing it in has resulted in the most delicious pourovers I've ever made.

That's why we introduced the k-cup line, and now we're bringing the renown quality from grinders like the Encore to our assembly line. And with our new proprietary quality assurance system, we've been working to streamline the home grinding experience too.""

And why the sudden merge?:

""Baratza started with no quality control on the home side. We can build great equipment, but what does it matter with subpar beans? Through our partnership, we've been able to assure this quality.""

""That's right Kyra, with our in bean quality assurance system, only the best beans will be able to be used in the home. Anything else will be reduced to a useless mess. You're sure to get k-cup quality every time! It really brings a tear to my eye.""

Brian reportedly wiped his face with a $100 bill following the closing of the interview.

I will never drink coffee the same way again,271689,False,True,"I received my French Press and Burr grinder yesterday and officially made my first authentic batch of pressed coffee this morning.

I went ahead and bought a pound of Sumatran beans from my local coffee shop which were roasted less than a day ago; going from already-ground Folgers coffee to freshly roasted and ground coffee is like no other.

I perused this subreddit and a couple of other sites on how to go about making it and wow, I am stunned by the palate of flavors coffee truly has which is masked by your run of the mill coffee maker with pre-ground coffee. 

With that, thank you /r/Coffee  ",195,970,2014-06-01 07:51:02

Why do you love coffee?,d35p85,False,True,"I'm trying to understand exactly what it is that makes us love coffee. For me it's quite a sensory experience. The smell of the beans, frothing the milk... is this something you all feel too? This is also the case when buying coffee from a coffee shop, The vibe/ smell/ presentation makes such a difference to how much I enjoy the drink. Do you agree?",192,974,2019-09-12 03:05:43
"Beginner here, though I can tell the difference between decent coffee and bad coffee, I'm struggling to build my palette to recognise all these different tastes and aromas.",aog92i,False,True,"As stated, I've been drinking coffee for a while, but I don't have access to a grinder. It's always been pre-ground coffee, and I've not had much chance to really prepare coffee properly. I know the difference between bad coffee and good coffee, but there's not really a huge difference between good cups of coffee for me. I want to change that.

I don't have a huge budget to purchase much equipment, but I have heard that grinders are really the most important thing for taste.

If I want to build a palette with a small budget, what's the best route? Do I get a cheap grinder and pre roast beans? Or do I go for both a roaster and a grinder that is cheap? I can't really afford more than $100 at this point.

My Japanese friend really recommends the really slow dripper method that she uses and apparently many Japanese use too, but I haven't had a chance to try it As of yet.",193,975,2019-02-08 04:55:06
Help me make an iced coffee that doesn’t taste like crap,8kcxgf,False,True,"I’m an avid coffee drinker, and I really have no issue making it hot.

Non coffee drinker needs help brewing for a friend who drank too much last night.,6p1960,False,True,"This is my first post on Reddit... 

I drove a dear friend of mine home last night after a pretty tame house party where she drank far too much. I helped her puke and get into bed and spent most of the night reassuring her through a bout of violent hiccups and quiet crying that I would not take advantage of her.  She finally fell asleep about 6 hours ago. She is dealing with a lot of hurt, which is why she got so drunk last night I think. 

I'm awake now and I want to make her some coffee to really wake and sober her up when she gets up, but I don't drink coffee and I don't know how much to use. I would like to make it fairly strong, I know she won't mind, but it's been 20 years since I made a pot for my parents and I have never made less than a whole pot. 

Please help. I think she might wake anytime. ",195,977,2017-07-23 06:21:53
I stopped drinking coffee,66p4b9,False,True,"So I realized that I have never really been energized or truly feel the ""coffee buzz"" that people so often talk about.  Coffee does not seem to wake me up or keep me awake.  I thought that maybe this was due to building a tolerance on coffee and decided lets pull back and see what happens.  So, I decided to stop drinking coffee and see its effects on me.  For background I usually wake up every morning weigh my beans, grind for the particular brew, and enjoy a large cup or two.  Additionally I usually follow this up with another cup midway through the day.  Fearing the worst and having heard rumors I was expecting to have headaches and feel terrible without my daily routine,  however I didn't experience any of that.  After 3 weeks I really just missed making and drinking coffee.  Wondering if anyone has had similar experiences to this in terms of ""not being affected by caffeine"".",193,978,2017-04-21 06:17:19
r/Coffee is a generous place,2wp02y,False,True,"Back in a post a couple weeks ago (http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/2uvflk/giveaway_i_have_a_mio_star_coffeemaker_that_i/), u/Lockeylom was looking to give away his lightly-used Mio Star drip coffee maker. He mailed it to me, at considerable cost to himself, and even included a fistful of chocolate.

Thanks Lockeylom and thanks r/Coffee! This replaces a drip coffee maker older than myself. I will pass the machine on when the time comes; it may not be a fine espresso machine, but it takes my daily up a couple notches for sure.",190,979,2015-02-21 13:25:51
