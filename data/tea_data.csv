Thank you /r/tea for making me feel absolutely loved.,agdw4z,False,True,"During Thanksgiving this year, a fire started in my parents house which destroyed most of my childhood possessions and countless other things, specifically my teas that I've grown to count on as a perpetual influence on both my mindfulness and mental health.

Oolongs and  puerhs, many rare and irreplaceable, gone in a second. It was a collection I spent years making. I made a post earlier before the New Year about it, and the love in those messages and responses was incredible. Many offered to send packages in support, and the sheer amount of tea I've received has made me believe how powerful little acts can be, specifically from this subreddit. I just want to say thank you all. I don't know which users you are, but I want to say it over and over.

Thank you.


Everything is easier now for some unknown reason, and the sheer joy of it all is at times overwhelming. I want to let everyone know that when you doubt in the genuine goodness of our fellow human beings, please don't.

The moderators will forward your shipping information to the vendor offering your prize.  Some prizes will be awarded via coupon code which you must redeem on the corresponding vendor’s website.  
  
The super fine print:  If you are selected as a winner but have entered by mistake, do not agree with the terms, or do not want your prize for any reason, another winner for that prize slot may be selected.  If you do not respond within 1 week to the message that you have won a prize, your prize may be given to a runner-up.  Prizes are donated by and shipped by various vendors and are subject to change from the above descriptions based on vendor limitations in stock or availability, and the moderators cannot change the items included in the prize or exchange a prize for any other items, including cash.  Winners receiving a prize shipped from another country should allow ample time for shipping and be aware of and responsible for of any possible import/customs taxes or fees required by your country.
